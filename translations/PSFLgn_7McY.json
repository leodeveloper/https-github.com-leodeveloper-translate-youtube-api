    "t_english": "- Hi, everyone, Sal here from Khan Academy, and as some of y'all know, I have released my second book, \"Brave New Words\", about the future of AI in education and work. It's available wherever you might buy your books. But as part of the research for that book, I did some interviews with some fascinating people, which you are about to watch. I have two very exciting guests today. I have Dr. Peggy Buffington, who's the superintendent of the Hobart School District in Indiana, in the Greater Chicago Area, I guess we can say. And we also have Dr. Tim Krieg, who's the director of Secondary Curriculum and Instruction at School City of Hobart. Welcome to both of you. - Thank you for having us today. - Yes, thank you so much. - So let me just start. No, well thanks for joining, and let me just start with a very basic question, before we get into some of the things that we've been collaborating with over the last several months. When ChatGPT hit the scene at the end of November of 2022, or early December, and y'all started learning about it and maybe hearing the rumors that the students might be using it for essays or for other things, what was y'all's reactions? What were y'all thinking about? What were you hearing from your teachers? And maybe start with you, Dr. Buffington. - Well, at first, and just to give you some background in terms of technology use, you know, I started reading everything that I could about it and making an account, figuring out the intricacies of it. And I've approached it in a sense that I would, with any type of technology, which would be, wow, how are we going to integrate this, use it, and not be afraid of it. And I think that that was the most important approach that I could take to it, just simply because this isn't something that, let's just say, when Google came out or when we first started introducing how to use the internet, people didn't really have a clue as to how they would integrate that with teaching, or with their curriculum. So I immediately started thinking about how are we going to help people see this as a tool and they can't run from it. And basically what I really thought was going to happen is exactly what happened. Everybody turned to the plagiarism and are we gonna do something to block this? And so I was like, \"Whoa, wait just a second here.\" Let's try to figure out, first of all, we knew that you had to be 18-years-old to use ChatGPT, but we know that that doesn't stop kids from making fake accounts. And we knew that we were going to have this issue with it, and we have to, we have to embrace and start figuring out how we're going to use it. And quite frankly, what's really interesting, Sal, is that I had a second grader that created his own recycled monster for a project, and his dad helped him go to ChatGPT to write a story about it. So if second graders are going to already be using this, we have to see that this is going to be a tool that kids are going to embrace. So how do we teach them how to use it ethically, and it's their voice, and not run from it? And so that was our position from the very beginning. But I can tell you that the teachers were all like, \"What are you gonna do to block it?\" Until we started having this kind of dialogue. Why would we block something that could potentially help a student? We just have to learn how to use it, right? - And how do you respond? Because a good number of those concerns are real. I'm a humanities teacher and I'm used to assigning term papers, and now students might be using ChatGPT and they're, you know, I think you can't detect it. I know there's folks who are claiming that they're gonna create some technology, but you really can't detect it if someone's even vaguely creative about it. What have you been telling those or have y'all started changing practice inside the district, and Dr. Buffington, you can continue and then I'm really curious, Tim, how you feel about these issues. - Well, I mean, I am gonna say that there were some English teachers, you can imagine, those are the first to speak up and say, \"Wow, they're out policing.\" And look, I think that this is this and I ran this checker. And it was very interesting to see their approach to it. And one of the things that I really do believe is that we have to change the way we're assigning things to kids. And you're going to have to show them and teach them how to appropriately use it. Because there has to be discernment, there has to be ethical use of, is this your voice or someone else's voice? And how do you prove that it's true, how are you citing it, and all of these things. Because it just makes us look at things differently. Now, I don't know how quickly you wanna get into our experiences with Khanmigo, but what I can say is that we started looking at, even prior to piloting Khanmigo, what would be an acceptable use of AI? And before they started piloting, it was really about making sure that there's discernment, making sure that we're representing your voice and you're not just copying and pasting something. So we started looking at perhaps a rubric with no AI, a little bit of AI, and what would you allow it to be used for? And then, you know, like, what does full blown AI look like? And are you going to use that for discourse and debate? So we kind of started having that kind of conversation to not just completely ban it, but to talk about what would you allow. And then I think we'll get more into what we discovered with Khanmigo, but that's kind of the dialogue we started having with people. - Super helpful. And Dr. Krieg, what's your point of view on both of those? What was your first reaction when you saw ChatGPT come on the scene and what have you been hearing from your teachers and others about how to navigate it? - It's a great question, and it's actually really interesting for me because Dr. Buffington had me leading a late start, which, late start means for us, all of our staff is sitting together and the students come late, so we can do collective professional development. And I don't remember exactly what it was that I had the staff working on, but at the end, one of our engineering teachers came up to me and he said, and this was in November of 2022, and he said, \"Hey, I responded to the question.\" He's like, \"What do you think about it?\" And so I read it and I said, \"Oh, very well done, Daniel, this is great.\" And he goes, \"I didn't write it.\" And I said, \"Okay.\" And so that was my first real iteration with ChatGPT that put it on the radar. Now, being one who is a former English teacher, I'd be remiss not to say at that point what did I do, right? Dr. Buffington talked about this, I like books, you can see books behind me. Dr. Buffington likes books, she has them all over. I started to research, right? And, you know, quite frankly, I think there's something crippling about what I like to refer to as acronym-itis, meaning, you know, we have acronyms for everything. And so, you know, dispelling this notion of like, what is that, you know, ChatGPT or whatever the case may be. And you come to find out that, you know, all of this gets embedded into what's considered AI, right? Artificial intelligence. And so that then kind of took me down a rabbit trail, if you will, to, you know, looking at what is AI and is this new or is it in a different iteration, right? So I went from not having any idea what it was to then reading, you know, articles about, you know, major school districts in the country, for example, that were going to ban this, and so forth. At that point I said to myself, well, you know, that's understandable. It's human nature, you know, survivalists, to try to protect ourselves, right, and put up those hedges of protection. Well then the more that you look into it, you know, as a former English teacher, I know that a lot of these terms that we use, like AI for example, they're a lot of times based in things that are, you know, science fiction related. I mean, you look all the way back at AI and, you know, it's like \"The Wizard of Oz.\" You know, Tin Man, right? Like, is this possible, you know, that I could have a being, if you will, this created thing that can reason, right? And so it's so fascinating, like a heartless Tin Man, right, and the concept of artificially intelligent robots. And you look back and this isn't anything new, it's taken on a different iteration as technology has caught up. And so, you know, I started to look into it and I'm like, \"Oh my gosh.\" You know, back in the 1950s, you know, this was being talked about, right? And so philosophers were trying to explore this and there was a, I don't remember the guy's name, but a British mathematician that tried to create the possibility of, you know, is there proof of this. - Alan Turing. - Yeah. And it was like, you see this all over fiction, you know. A little short story called \"The Most Dangerous Game.\" And, you know, looking at animals and humans and the ability to reason as the differentiator. And so, you know, the problem was, as we all know, you know, technology wasn't ready, you know, at the time. And so you see this like whole notion of artificial intelligence that just went through decades of changes, right? It was like a rollercoaster. It was up and down and all over the place. And so, you know, that then obviously led to the current era we're in, where technology can keep up, right? And so now we see this really like societal shift where all of a sudden the engineering teacher is using this thing, but I don't even know what it is, you know, acronym-itis, ChatGPT. And what do you do? You put up your hedges of protection, right? Like, I don't know what this is and it's scary, right? And so I think one of the most important things to that point then was, you know, as soon as we had that conversation, you know, then like Dr. Buffington, as the leader she is, she already knew about this. I was late to the party, right? But then we start to problem solve together and think and explore. And I think what makes this district unique and why we value the partnership we have with Khan and why I think we're on the line with you right now is just because, you know, thing about \"Brave New Words.\" You know, Dr. Buffington's a trailblazer and she's not afraid to look at things in a non-binary way, right? Have or don't have, good or bad. What about the gray areas, right? And these are tools just like calculators. You look at the changes to the new digital SAT, you know. They have a Desmos infused calculator that's, there's no such thing anymore for the new SAT of a calculator or no calculator section. Well, this is the reality of where we are, and it doesn't necessarily have to be dystopian if we can, to Dr. Buffington's point, work with our staff and students to be wise stewards of these resources, because it's not going to change, right? And so I think for me, you know, Dr. Buffington in her dissertation, you know, what do you start with, a definition of terms? And so when you start to research things, you start to realize, are we even talking about the same thing, right? Are we defining our terms or are we just going around and around and around about things that we don't even understand what they are? Right? - Right, can I jump in there for just a second, because one of the things, as a technology user back in the day, back in the '80s, you know, and I did my internship with Apple Computer in instructional design, and, you know, and you're trying to figure out how do you get teachers to embrace technology, not be afraid of it. And you have to really say to yourself, the number one thing that they wanna know is the, how is this gonna make my job better? How is it going to help my students? And if you can't sell them on that, you might as well forget it. And so then, if you can sell them that it will make their job better and make achievement more accessible for their students, and they're on board with that, then you have to lay out a good plan to teach them how to use it. And so what I really feel, one of the first things that's so exciting about it is when you start talking to them about it, is just make an account, right? You wanna know how to make the best carbonara? Ask that question, right, and see what you get. And they're fascinated by it. It's kind of like using the search engine for the first time, and you come up with all these hits and then you say, \"Well, you have to refine it to get what you want.\" So you can regenerate questions, right? And so they find these little things to be fascinating, and then you take those extra little steps to show them things like how to generate an exit ticket. And then they're starting to see a little bit of use and they're going, \"Whoa!\" So a case in point, the engineering teacher that was talking to Dr. Krieg, he comes up and he is like, \"Wow, I just turned in my Hobart Educational Foundation grant, and I wrote all of it in ChatGPT.\" And of course he was awarded it. He had to go in and tweak a few things, and he's like, \"It was amazing.\" And we're like, all right, great job, you found a use for it. My director of technology and my IT person, our student management system, something was not quite working right in a report that they had to do. They went behind in the back end and some code that they thought was wrong, and they put it in in ChatGPT, and then it came back and it corrected. They were able to correct it, and they said, \"Wow!\" Our food service director, looking at something that they had to do for a federal report, went out and was doing some things in ChatGPT. Now, as we all know, it's not the end all be all. They do still have to check things and have discernment, right? So the point is is that, when you're introducing this, whether it's terms or whatever, if you can't show some great benefit, you're gonna be turned off. And then I think the other aspect of this is teaching teachers once they see that resource side of it, because, quite frankly, the resource side is really great for teachers when they start looking at it, how do I make assignments that utilize this type of technology? You know, and I think about that narrative, that essay, and, you know, when I think about 21st century skills with collaborating with a team and having like that discourse and debate over, you know, what is artificial intelligence telling you? And then you regenerate and you get another answer and another answer, and you're on that team and you're discussing and debating what's accurate, what's real, what's possible, and then you're starting to formulate some sort of hypothesis or thematic type of situation where you're gonna expand on it. I think that it has great potential, when we teach people just how to use it appropriately. And we have to look to the future and say, they're going to do this. Our competitors globally are going to use this. Why in the world would we ban something? And then they're going to go out into the real world and use it. So it's our job to use it and use it well. Teach them ethical use, teach them how to strategically use it to get an end product. So I think that our teachers need that type of help. And so you start off with, how does it benefit me as a teacher? And now, how am I gonna use this with my kids? And boy do I have, you know, I have some really great ideas on how we can use this with kids, just with, I love the coaching aspect of it, I love the differentiation, but that's more on the Khanmigo side, and I know you're gonna get to that with us, because I do love Khanmigo. I'm just saying. - No, I mean, I obviously, I'm biased, I love Khanmigo, but I get more enthusiastic about it every time I talk to you, Dr. Buffington. And, you know, for those listening, several of the teacher features are direct ideas from Dr. Buffington. So your feedback is definitely manifesting itself in our product. But let's switch gears to that, because Hobart was already a district that was pretty engaged, heavily engaged using, let's call it pre-AI Khan Academy. Then we showed y'all early demos of Khanmigo, and since March, y'all have been one of the first districts in the country, probably the world, to use Khanmigo in a systematic way, and it seems in a productive way. What were y'all's original reactions to Khanmigo? What questions or aspirations do you still have for it? And what's been the experience like over the last several months? I'll start with you, Dr. Buffington, and then go to Dr. Krieg. - Well, I love the aspect of confidence in a student, right? So I mean, anything that you wanna read on student achievement has to start with building confidence that they have within themselves, that they know they can do it. And so our job then is to make sure that we're equipping them with the skills that they can manifest themselves and have this confidence level. And one of the things that pre-COVID, and then you can just now jump forward to COVID, is that you just started to notice that kids really are not asking questions. They don't wanna raise their hand. And then you're the teacher trying to pull, you're soliciting, you're coming up with hooks, you're trying to engage kids. It's difficult. And yet I can go to an elementary school and what do I watch kids do on a Chromebook, an iPad, whatever? They're automatically going out, hitting the microphone, \"Show me a blue snake and tell me why it's blue.\" Right? And they love that kind of stuff. And so they're so apt to talk to their device and they love the response that they get, and then it makes them a little more excited to ask it and get a little more specific with it. So one of the things that I love about watching this with Khanmigo is just that tutor, that guide on the side, and kids not afraid to ask the device a question. And I think that it's ingenious because they'll sit and ask questions all day long. And if they have an assignment that is geared, and let's just say it's the writing essay. And, you know, Sal, when I first did the first talk with you, you're gonna crack up at this, but you were talking about your son having to write an essay, right? And so I only had five teachers that were piloting this, but yet I'm so excited about it, I'm talking to everybody about it, right? I'm like, \"You would not believe what Sal Khan showed us.\" And then I had a student that I was mentoring at the middle school, and she's like, \"Dr. Buffington, is that AI stuff ready yet?\" Because she needed a writing coach, right? And so then I'm like, well, I'll pretend to be AI like Khanmigo, and I said, \"I'll be your writing coach.\" And I was trying to pretend like asking, I would prompt a question like I would think that AI would do, and not that I replaced your Khanmigo, Sal. But here's what I can tell you. She wrote a six paragraph essay on mystery, and it was beautiful. She needed that extra help with just asking questions and getting answers, and pushing her a little bit. And it was beautiful. And one of the things that the feedback, that our teachers told us, how great is it to have a tutor or an assistant or a coach when I'm not available? And they loved that because they see their, and these are high school teachers that said, I'm not up at two in the morning when they're done playing Minecraft and they decide to start writing their paper and boom, they have a teaching assistant, and they're asking questions and they come to school and they feel confident in their work. And so I think that that is the beauty of this. Now, I'm still going to come back as your educator and make sure that you have applied and it's your voice, and you are representing what I've assigned to you. But wow, the confidence level in kids is amazing. And that's what I like about it. Any time you can have a tutor right then and there, and I think that that is the best part of it. I do think that the feedback that we've been able to give you, that you've made the program even better, is the whole chat history, right? So I can see how long you've engaged, what type of questions you're asking, and it's not just a quick get this done copy paste sort of thing. You really are out there using discernment, refining, and asking the right questions to turn in a great piece of work. I love this about this. Questioning, tutoring, confidence building. That's all what we want for our students. - You know, I hear two really powerful themes there. One is the confidence building aspect of it, which on introspection makes all the sense in the world. If the students can just get more confident and get their questions answered, they're gonna engage more. And then the other one, which you just alluded to, which is the process over just the output. And that, AI, interestingly I think, gives us a lens into the process that we never had before, because you're not going to see what a student is doing at two in the morning while they're writing their essay, and they might be getting their older sister to write it for them or something like that. And now you get a lens. Dr. Krieg, what about yourself? You know, what was your initial reaction to Khanmigo, especially vis-a-vis your reaction to ChatGPT, and how's been the experience so far? - That's a great question. You know, quite frankly, when you, you know, that you can go to all different kinds of workshops and read books and, you know, it's helpful. It gives you a spark. But, you know, it's like, how do I take that spark and really allow that spark to take on like an organic nature to it, to where it just becomes embedded in how you do things, right? We talk about culture, we talk about climate. And I see things like, you know, equity and access and, you know, we talk about learning loss and we talk about, you know, how the Matthew effect, right? The haves keep having and the have nots don't. How do we get into that gap and truly provide opportunities? I was at a workshop yesterday with a colleague, and we were looking at the new digital SAT, and my colleague, who's an educator and an involved parent, she said, \"Well, you know, I was working with my daughter and, you know, she didn't understand this, that, and the other.\" And so, you know, I'm like, well, we can get you a tutor, you know, and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. And it really got me thinking about this again, because it's like, what about Khanmigo? Well, we've, to your point, and to Dr. Buffington's point, we've been on, you know, the Khan Academy track for a long time now. I've used it from a student's perspective, a teacher's perspective, and now, through Khan districts, an administrative perspective. But what I'm seeing with Khanmigo is the ability to take the ideas that people have and really make it to where it's systemic. And so I think as we move further and further away from rote memory, and you start to see lines blurred. I mean, our students are creators, they're producers, they are songwriters, they are singers, they are podcasters, right? They're curators, they're consumers of media and information, but they're also creating it. And so what does all of that take? It takes increased depth of knowledge, complexity, interacting with materials, right? Interacting with concepts, et cetera. Well, the problem is, if you think about the Matthew effect and, you know, the ability of some situations socioeconomically and culturally, whereby they are able to fill gaps, identify them and fund them, what about everybody else? What about those who don't have access to such types of things? And even if they do, what if it's not working? And so we hear all about, you know, student apathy and lack of engagement and, you know, whatever the case is, and this is a question I'll ask. I'll say, okay, let's just say we do get your students' attention. You have a captivated audience. What are you gonna do with it? Let's flip the script on that, right? And so I think what's exciting to me, as we use this beta mode of Khanmigo, and as we're observing with it, you're seeing students interacting with knowledge and concepts in a way that's increasing the complexity of what they're doing. And it's not a interact, it's not a, the best way to put it would be a transaction, right? It's not just a, okay, I need this, you give me that. It's an ongoing relationship whereby students are interacting with new material, or challenging themselves, or expanding what they thought was to be true. And that readmission of learning is what we're all passionate about, right? So we talk here a lot about, you know, how do we find ways to marry up passions, purpose, possibilities, et cetera. And so when I look at Khanmigo, to Dr. Buffington's point, if I'm a teacher, it's not teaching for you, right? But what can it do? It can help refresh knowledge. It can, you know, create and partner with the teacher to create hooks, right? It can help the teacher by creating exit tickets with them. It can help with lesson planning. It can give, you know, there's even a neat little feature where you could take an entire lesson and it turns it into a fun little poem, right? You can co-create rubrics, all that kind of stuff, right? Learning objectives, use it as a tool to Dr. Buffington's point. And then, on the learner side. Go ahead. - That, I mean like, some of the most exciting things during the pilot that they were finding out, that you could talk to a literary figure. Oh my gosh! Or you could talk to someone historically and then you're, it just put them in the moment and it just brought learning to life. And so it's so engaging. You know, when I think about, for years we've said, differentiation, you know, that was one of the biggies on Khan Academy. And as you have said, and as Dr. Kreig has said, we were using Khan Academy, we were early adopters. I loved it. We had our own, we even made our own Khan Academy dictionary, it was pretty funny, on how to use it. But what did I like about that? I liked that there was differentiation. There was that guide on the side, some extra help, right? And I see Khanmigo as exactly that, but I also see it as totally engaging. So I can look at it, wow, differentiation, and, as an educator, I really didn't have to do that much to provide that differentiation. And it is a guide on the side. But on the same token, it's not something that kids don't wanna do. They like it. Now, one of our English teachers, and I totally cracked up at this, is that one of the kids said, and he was interacting with a historical figure with Khanmigo, and the kid said, \"This is more fun than TikTok.\" So Sal, you've made it. It's more enlightening than TikTok. And when kids tell you that, you know you got something there. But anyways, I think that that's a big plus with this. This is not where I just have to get my assignment done. They're actually out there and they're engaging with it, and they're taking it to new levels. And we found with some of the kids that were a part of the pilot, they were doing things that were not part of their assignment. They were out creating things, creating like companies, and putting in these scenarios. It was just hysterical. We didn't ask them to do that. They just really liked it. And so I think that that is what we want for kids. We want them to wonder. We want them to innovate. We want them to be problem solvers and go out there and take the information and do something with it. And that's what really happened with this. I do think, again, that beauty of just going back and looking at, as an educator, the chat history, so I know what they're doing, I can see safety, I can see their work, et cetera, that's really important to educators. But I think this has opened up a whole different meaning to engagement and what are they wondering, and what do they wanna know more about, and what do they want to do with it? And I do find that the kids that we serve today, I do think that they have a heart for other people, and they are problem-solvers. I do think that they have an entrepreneurial, you know, being, that they want to make things and they want to be successful at it, they want it to serve other people, problem solve, and they want to be successful with what they've made. This is just such a game-changer with equity. And I think that Dr. Krieg said that pretty well. I can take an English language learner, which we piloted with our EL teacher, and just a game-changer for them. I mean, their primary language is not a stumbling block for them. They're on par with their classmates. And that's pretty awesome. One of the things too that, you know, we're talking to our AP chemistry teacher, also a dual credit early college teacher, just looking at some of the equations that they were doing in chemistry. And, you know, Khanmigo wouldn't give them the answer, but it was probing them to how to get the answer. And so our teachers loved that, you know. If you're at home trying to solve that problem and they can't help you, Khanmigo was there to assist them. Now, I will tell you that they all said that sometimes the kids started bullying AI because they just wanted the answer and it wouldn't do it. So that made the teachers pretty happy. Just to let you know, there's some feedback for you. There was a little bullying going on at times with Khanmigo, and it, you know, it just kept prompting them and said, I'm not gonna give you the answer. - Yeah, we have to teach- - We liked that part of it. - I think the golden rule should apply to AI. Treat the AI as you wish you're treated yourself. I mean, just continuing on that feedback lens. And I wasn't joking when, you know, our last meeting, we have several features on Khanmigo that directly came out of that meeting. So I'm gonna continue to pick y'all's brain. You know, some of the things that we are working on above and beyond what you're already experiencing. We're working on giving the artificial intelligence, giving Khanmigo a sense of memory, so that it knows the tone that a teacher or a student prefers. It remembers previous conversations, it can pick up where you left off. We're adding things where teachers can assign through Khanmigo both traditional Khan Academy activities and AI activities. And potentially fine tune the activity, instead of saying, \"Talk to historical characters.\" Like, \"Hey, I want you to talk to Benjamin Franklin and figure out the following.\" And so we're gonna be doing things like that. We already have a little bit of this, but we're gonna have more on reporting, where Khanmigo really acts as a teaching assistant. You mentioned English language learners. We just released that it now works in every major language. And so a student could be doing their math or their chemistry in English, but they could be getting their help or their tutoring in Spanish or Portuguese or Hindi or whatever language they might need. And then the other thing that we are hoping to do, let's call it in the next six months is, have the AI, have activities that are multi-user, facilitate collaborative learning amongst many students. So, you know, you can imagine, instead of having a debate with the AI, maybe the AI could facilitate a debate with several students. Or run a Socratic dialogue with several students or do a simulation or a game with several students. So I'd love y'all's thoughts are, you know, what already exists of that list that I just talked to you, maybe you're extra excited about. Any ideas on how to tweak it? Any concerns, and on the risk side, what would you like to see more of? Are there are, have you been seeing problems that you wanna make sure that we can address to just make things go smoother? I'll start with you, Dr. Buffington. - Well, I think one of the things that we gave feedback on, obviously sometimes we pick up on things that are safety concerns for us. And I think that you addressed, you know, immediately you started digging into like, how can we make sure that if there is some sort of risk to a student or to other people with just what we, there's an indicator system. And so we so appreciate that you took that feedback, because a lot of the times we're able to pick that up in class or in some work or body of work that, or if a student has been talking to another student or a teacher, we're able to pick up some signs of things that where a student may need extra help, because they're going through a very bad time. Or there is just some potential there for, you know, wrong application or something to that effect. And so I think that you took our feedback pretty well in terms of us having concern for kids that may need some extra social emotional support, or if their safety is being compromised in their home or with other people. I think that that was one of our biggest concerns when we first started the pilot. Because we have things like that in place right now, and I see kids using Khanmigo more than, I mean, I just think they're gonna use it a lot. And so if they're going to use that a lot, I like that you have built in some safety measures. That was really important to us. In terms of going forward, I think engagement is really important and communicating with other people. Thank you so much for the language portion that you just created, because I think that is vitally important right now. And I would just say, one of the things that I think is really important, and I think this goes back to the age old question, and we really get this from middle school kids more than anyone, like, why do I have to learn that? And I think having experts out in the field, if we could, besides the AI portion being that expert, when you're saying that they can communicate with other students, I would love to see a database or, besides the AI expert, I would like to see experts out in the field. Because a lot of the times with college and career readiness and thinking about these are gonna be our next leaders, you know, talking to people and understanding what they do for a living and how it might be changing, and just the whole concept of AI. Let me give a case endpoint. So right now, when you think about computer science, and we're talking about coding and just trying to get kids to go into coding and computer science, it's going to be different now. AI gives it a whole different flavor, and I think that they need to be talking to, besides the AI expert, who are those people out in the field? Like your people. Like how does this work behind the scenes? And what, and you wanna do this for a living? And if you really enjoy it, it's really not even a job. But I think that there needs to be more of that. And so, you know, there's software out there that you can meet up with an expert here, an expert there. But giving kids a real flavor for it. And then, I mean, you can still, if you're going to allow them to meet with other kids, I'd like to see them meet with other experts out in the field. - It's a fascinating idea. I think y'all know we have another sister nonprofit that I started during the pandemic called schoolhouse.world, which, and the whole premise of schoolhouse.world is, you know, it's connect the world through learning and give folks free live tutoring via video conference. And the way we do that is by leveraging volunteers. Many of the volunteers are high school or college students, but many of them are professionals. And when we launched Khanmigo we started to think, well maybe Khanmigo could be an interesting bridge between traditional Khan Academy and maybe something like schoolhouse.world, where you actually have real people showing up. And so, Peggy, your idea, I'm almost thinking of like, what if schoolhouse.world, I think most professionals would love to give back in some way. They would love to tell, you know, most parents, when they go home, they wanna tell their kids about their job and their kids aren't interested. But the kids might be interested about other parents' jobs, which tends to be the case. And so there might be a fun way where you can show up on these, on say a schoolhouse, and then Khanmigo can say, hey, you were wondering why this matters. There's a session that's happening. So-and-so is showing up who's a AI researcher, or who's a doctor, or who's a lawyer, who can talk about, why don't you go to that, and you'll learn a lot more about why this algebra is useful. So I love that idea. Dr. Krieg, more ideas, keep them coming, we can't- - Yeah, no, I- - And fears, and risks, 'cause those are also ideas that, you know, opportunities for us to make it better. - So, quite frankly, to go right off that note, I remember as a student, I didn't understand why Shakespeare, for instance. And, you know, in college, when I was an undergrad and then grad school and whatnot, I started to have a different appreciation for it. But ironically, to Dr. Buffington's point, what really started that was this short little video that I stumbled upon, where there were actors and actresses who were talking about why Shakespeare. And for the first time I started to view the theater, for example, not just in its own siloed reality, like, oh, this is theater, but as a bridge, if you will, like you mentioned, to all sorts of other occupations. And when you get to see and hear how things are hybrid now, right, things aren't siloed anymore, you can be in a subject and apply the concepts, the principles, the experiences, to not just other things that you're doing currently, but the possibilities are endless because we really don't know how that's going to come up later on, right? We're not even always consciously aware of it. And so when I think about the current activities for students inside of, through Khanmigo, I would encourage you to continue to look at ways to break silos down. And by that I mean, you know, it's like modes of writing. Modes of writing for far too long were taught in a way that was singular. So it's like, this is expository writing, this is argumentative writing, this is narrative writing. But, you know, research shows that the writing process of our most successful authors, it mirrors those of small children prior to going through a traditional K-12 education system, because of exactly what we talked about before. Curiosity. Is it a discipline? Sure. Read Stephen King on writing, he will tell you it's a discipline, it's a science, but there has to be that passion. And so for me, I think about what's the difference between what we have done, what we are doing, and what we could and should do. What we need to start to do, we could do and should do, is break down the walls between classes, break down the walls between in school and out of school. Dr. Buffington could tell you that our most successful things going on right now have been organic, and they then become systematic, where the engineering teacher partners up with the business teacher, who partners up with the teacher in PLTW biomed. Why, because they're aligned to passions. They're aligned to things you're interested in. So if I look at something like craft a story, understanding when you go out and you read and you listen to podcasts, part of argumentation is storytelling, right? There's no such thing as, oh, this is expository writing, so I only exposit information, right? Writing is messy. The writing process is non-linear. Everything evolves and changes. So to Dr. Buffington's point, two things here. One, applying these topics in a way that makes it more and more seamless, and that's why I love your comment, Sal, about having the journey be something that is building upon itself. And if the AI capability is such to where it allows the learning progression to continue, that's a game-changer. I had one of my best composition teachers in grad school, she talked about how, you know, writing should ultimately be assessed, not at these little, you know like, oh, well you took this class and earned an A or that class and earned a B. It should be, where did the students start, and then where did they end up at the natural end of the segment. And it's about that growth. Well, that growth is such to where you start to understand, oh, everything is rhetorical, right? You go back to Plato to, you know, Socrates, to Aristotle, whatever the case is, everything's rhetorical. Well, our students now are presenting to a world that is gigantic, but it can also be niche, right? How can we take these things that they're learning about history, about technology, about engineering, about, you know, the human body, all these different things and say, this could apply to fields that don't even exist. This could end up applying, it could be sticky, right? That's how our brains work. We need to stick information onto things that we already have frameworks built on, in such a way that now I'm combining something I'm doing in class with the side hustle I have, you know, a shop that I do on the side or whatever, and also at home in my own personal and, you know, preferences and whatever the case may be. So, for example, if I listen to podcasts about, you know, sports related things, that may then change the way that I do a recorded, you know, session for staff, because I like the way that they introduce this or that they, you know, use voice inflection there and whatnot. So my encouragement would be twofold. One, continue to break those silos down to show how all this stuff fits into other stuff, right? And then two, there's a little bit right now in Khanmigo, as it relates to like navigating college admissions and financial aid, you know, and then also like the career aspect. So I would say, I would encourage you to continue to connect students and what they're learning about or could learn about, with then what. And when you think about like the state of Indiana, for example, a lot of what Dr. Buffington and I and our team are doing here is helping align what students are doing now with stackable credentials of currency, showing future employers, scholarship committees, et cetera, that I have mastery of something or proficiency in something or experience in something. We see this even with digital badges and things of that nature. So when a student sees a career path, it's intimidating because the language that's used to characterize it might not have anything to do with really what the occupation entails. And or the future occupations I may use these things for don't even exist, right? And so how can we try to marry those worlds up to connect students present with their future in the shorter term, as well as, you know, the opportunities there that exist thereafter that we don't even know of yet. - I love that, this kind of theme of breaking down barriers between subjects, which I think is now more doable than ever. And then also between school and the real world. One last question for you Dr. Buffington. Let's fast forward, I don't know, two, three years. It doesn't have to be a long time, but things are changing very fast. Do you think that everything we've talked about is going to somehow fundamentally alter what school is like, including, you know, we didn't even talk about things like assessment, which we are starting to think about on our side. Or do you think it'll just be a nice supplement on top of the existing architecture? Or do you think in some ways it changes the classroom fundamentally, Dr. Buffington? - Well, I mean, Tim will know this, Dr. Krieg. I mean, I had the philosophy that, you know, during COVID, that the landscape was forever changed, right? I mean, it's already changed. If I don't wanna come to my public institution and sit all day, I can choose to go to an online school and, you know, maybe that works for me. I think that, I think when I look at this, I don't want to view this as supplemental. I wanna view this as a tool that is a tool that is, you know, it's usable now, but it's also able to help us in the future. You know, when I think about things and I think about college career readiness, and, you know, right now I can let a kid get out early, graduate early, and, you know, I have kids that are graduating with associates degrees in our high school right now. What do I see potentially happening here? I see what people want with the kids that are graduating from high school now. They want them to be problem solvers. They want them to be able to collaborate and work on a team. They want them to have ethical practices behind them. And I think that you already have the potential with this. Now the interesting thing is is that, how do I give a student an internship, and maybe in Khanmigo there's an internship aspect of this and it counts for their day. You know, I'm all about reinventing the high school and what that looks like. And, you know, I think that that funnels down to, you know, middle school, elementary. I think there's so many different aspects of this AI that I could explore. You know, when I think about, kids wanna have fun, they don't wanna dread assignments, I already see that that part is cured. I see kids going on there just because they want to, and they like asking questions. And that's what we want as educators. We want them asking questions. And they're fascinated by it. And so I wanna take that fascination and build on it. And if that means redesigning the way we do school, then we have to do that, right? And so we already have some redesigning and reinventing our high schools with early college and, you know, you can get industry certifications one year of college, two years of college. You don't necessarily need to go five days a week. You don't maybe need to go a whole day. Because you can have a different opportunity. And if that opportunity presents itself in such a way, you're credentialed to graduate and perhaps even enter the workforce or enter post-secondary to further explore what we're trying to achieve with, you know, some post-secondary credential that contributes to the world. And so I'm all about, is there better ways, more efficient ways or more exciting, engaging ways to reinvent things that we're doing? And I think that, I think like anything that's been new to education, sometimes we are the last adopters. And so why? And I think we started talking about this. They're afraid of it. And you can't be afraid of it, you have to embrace what the future is. And so I think there's gonna be some adaptability when you're talking about supplemental, right? I mean, like, so right now you're gonna have early adopters that are going to basically take something that they have in their curriculum map and say, \"How does AI help me?\" \"How might I use Khanmigo?\" And then you're going to start seeing some trailblazing where it'll be like, whoa, I'm not, it's not a replacement. And you're going to see them start using it in a way that enhances even more, and it's not replacing like what they did. And it's pushing kids to grow and learn and perhaps come up with an idea that they might cure something. You know, I love the fact that this is a generation that likes to problem solve. And they'll say like, \"What about this?\" Or, \"What about that?\" And I think that this has the potential to do that. So if I have a student and, you know, to talk about what we were talking about, we will put kids in a biomedical class and then we will have them butt up with the engineering program, because they're thinking about one thing and these are the people over here that can really build it for you or help you with your calculations or whatever. Those barriers are broken. And I see high school being totally reinvented with giving kids the opportunity to apply this in a real-world setting. And so I think that there's room for this, and I'm just gonna give you a concept here of, you know, Indiana's doing something with career scholarship accounts. They're called CSAs. And it's really meant to put kids out into the workforce, and work-based learning and internships. And they're already on the cusp of what would a high school diploma look like with a kid that we give this CSA to? And is it really the traditional, like you have to have 40 credits of this and that and that. And they're starting to see, well, eh, maybe they don't need that. And maybe, just maybe they're gonna be somebody that I put out in the workforce that has some know-how with using technology in an appropriate way, and come up with a solution for something that they've been struggling to find. I think the potential is there for that. I think you're gonna see early adopters supplementing, replacing, and then finding new things. And then I think you're going to see kids be like, I could do this, I could do that. And we're gonna have to re-look at the way we're delivering to allow growth, if that makes sense. - Makes a ton of sense. And, you know, I could talk to both of y'all for hours, especially about this topic, 'cause it's so fascinating. But I love that kind of final push where, you know, break all the boundaries and actually we always get our ideas from, activity ideas from you, Dr. Buffington. And you kind of reinforced something that we were brainstorming, which is, what if there was an activity for students, or for teachers or for anyone, to solve big problems in the world. You know, you need us, you need to tackle climate, you wanna figure out how can I, as a student, start to tackle climate change? How as I, as a student, can start to tackle cancer research? How can I, as a student, start to tackle, I don't know, whatever issue in the world you think needs solving. A lot of students want to, but they don't know where to start, where do they, so I like that idea as well. Well, thank you both- - And Sal can, Sal can I just mention in terms of what you just said and how important it is, and they try to solve things that are so important to them. So during COVID, one of my students was trying to figure out how to have a better check-in system with symptoms in the emergency room. - Hmm. - And why. She wanted it to notify them that you have to reprioritize who's in your emergency room, because her grandfather died from COVID. So I had this little entrepreneur innovator, and we have maker spaces here, we do, you know, we do makers' fairs, we have, and we have STEM spaces everywhere. And her creation was, and she worked with the engineers at the hospital on symptoms and where they're at, and how do we prioritize who you're going to see first, because it was so real to her, and to you. You know, when you're saying climate change, the things that really matter to them, they will spend all day. That is the type of student that won't go to bed because they're out there trying to figure out where's the information, what type of tool, what kind of instrument. She's in the biomed class, goes down to the engineering class and they're creating a handheld, and it's going to sync with watches or whatever at the hospital, to change the priority of like, who do you need to see now? And I just think that our kids have that potential, right? And so, guess what, that didn't happen in her classroom, that happened outside of her classroom, but she brought it into the classroom that there has to be a better way. Right? And so I think that this opens up all kinds of avenues of questions or problems that they wanna solve, and it gives them a good start and it will make them want to keep going after it. You know what I mean? And I think that's the beauty of it. It's so engaging, they don't wanna stop - 100%. Couldn't agree more. - Sal, if I may. Just on both of our behalfs, you know, thank you for, you know, that's what you did, right? You started by identifying a problem, a need, right, that was personal to you in a familial sense. And you asked a lot of questions and you trailblaze, and then, you know, here we are, right? And so what our hope is is that as passionate as the three of us are, for example, about education and, you know, Khanmigo, and just different ways to try to help our students, you know, be on mission, to be able to pursue their passions. If they can have that same kind of passion about things that they're interested in, and we're marrying up the possibilities where they can pursue 'em, then, you know, education may look different, but the fundamental, you know, true North Star remains the same. Right? - 100%. - And then we just, we just go about it in different ways, you know. But the why is still there. The denominator is still there. And that's our kids, that's our students. And so just thank you, I think, on both of our behalfs, for championing that. - No, well, thank y'all for being part of this. - Oh, hey- - For taking the time out. - This one. - Oh yeah. - This was the best thing ever. I mean, I'm not kidding you. I could sit and talk with the teachers and the kids that were using this. I could sit with them all day, and I, and they were sending me things that they were creating out of Khanmigo, and I was loving it and I have other work to do, but I wanted to read what they were doing with it. And, you know, I think, just kudos, and thank you for including us in the pilot. I think that we'll be trailblazers with going out and talking to people about how, you know, how to break the barriers and how to use it. But you can't do that without giving people an initial start. Right? And you did that, and I'm just telling you, it's fascinating to sit and talk to these teachers about how they think they're gonna use it next. And so thank you for that. You've taken something that I think that they were so afraid of, especially the English teachers. And they're not afraid of it. And so they know how they're gonna approach it. They're, you know, they did talk to our Secretary of Education, Katie Jenner, which is interesting because you had talked to Katie Jenner and she's like, \"Hey, I wanna talk to those teachers.\" And so we lined it up and she was fascinated by it too. So you've taken something and given us a really good tool to use in education. And for that, we're grateful for it, and I can't wait to see the next version. - No, we're excited, and I think this is gonna be one of many conversations over the next few months and years, as we go on this adventure together. But thank you because you know, you know, obviously we can do all this work, but if we're not serving the needs of school leaders and teachers and students, then why are we doing this? So it means a lot to be able to partner with y'all. Thank y'all. - Thank you, Sal.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",
    "t_urdu": "- ہیلو، سب،\nخان اکیڈمی کی طرف سے یہاں سال، اور جیسا کہ آپ سب جانتے ہیں، میں نے تعلیم اور کام میں AI کے مستقبل کے بارے میں\nاپنی دوسری کتاب \"Brave New Words\" جاری کی ہے۔ \n یہ دستیاب ہے جہاں سے بھی\nآپ اپنی کتابیں خرید سکتے ہیں۔ لیکن اس کتاب کی تحقیق کے حصے کے طور پر، میں نے کچھ دلچسپ لوگوں کے ساتھ کچھ انٹرویوز کیے\n، جنہیں آپ دیکھنے والے ہیں۔ آج میرے پاس دو بہت پرجوش مہمان ہیں۔ میرے پاس ڈاکٹر پیگی بفنگٹن ہیں،\nجو انڈیانا کے ہوبارٹ سکول ڈسٹرکٹ کے سپرنٹنڈنٹ ہیں، گریٹر شکاگو\nایریا میں، میرا اندازہ ہے کہ ہم کہہ سکتے ہیں۔ اور ہمارے پاس ڈاکٹر ٹم کریگ بھی ہیں، جو ہوبارٹ کے سکول سٹی میں ثانوی\nنصاب اور ہدایات کے ڈائریکٹر ہیں۔ آپ دونوں کو خوش آمدید۔ - آج ہمارے پاس رکھنے کے لئے آپ کا شکریہ۔ - جی ہاں، بہت شکریہ.\n- تو مجھے شروع کرنے دو۔  نہیں۔ \n جب ChatGPT\n2022 کے نومبر کے آخر میں، یا دسمبر کے شروع میں منظرعام پر آیا، اور آپ سب نے\nاس کے بارے میں سیکھنا شروع کر دیا اور شاید یہ افواہیں سنیں کہ طالب علم\nاسے مضامین یا دیگر چیزوں کے لیے استعمال کر رہے ہیں،\nآپ سب کا ردعمل کیا تھا؟  ? آپ سب کیا سوچ رہے تھے؟ آپ اپنے اساتذہ سے کیا سن رہے تھے؟ اور شاید آپ سے شروع کریں، ڈاکٹر بفنگٹن۔ - ٹھیک ہے، شروع میں، اور صرف\nآپ کو ٹیکنالوجی کے استعمال کے حوالے سے کچھ پس منظر دینے کے لیے ، آپ جانتے ہیں، میں نے اس کے بارے میں جو کچھ کر سکتا تھا اسے پڑھنا شروع کر دیا\n اور اس کی پیچیدگیوں کا پتہ لگا کر ایک اکاؤنٹ بنانا شروع کر دیا۔ اور میں نے اس سے اس لحاظ سے رابطہ کیا ہے\nکہ میں، کسی بھی قسم کی ٹیکنالوجی کے ساتھ،\nجو ہو گا، واہ، ہم\nاسے کیسے مربوط کریں گے، اسے استعمال کریں گے، اور اس سے خوفزدہ نہیں ہوں گے۔ اور میں سمجھتا ہوں کہ یہ\nسب سے اہم نقطہ نظر تھا جسے میں اپنا سکتا تھا، صرف اس وجہ سے کہ یہ کوئی ایسی\nچیز نہیں ہے، آئیے صرف یہ کہتے ہیں کہ جب گوگل سامنے آیا یا جب ہم نے پہلی بار انٹرنیٹ استعمال کرنے کا طریقہ متعارف کرانا شروع کیا تو لوگوں نے ایسا\nنہیں کیا۔  واقعی میں اس بات کا کوئی اشارہ نہیں ہے کہ وہ\nاسے تدریس کے ساتھ، یا اپنے نصاب کے ساتھ کیسے مربوط کریں گے۔ تو میں نے فوراً اس بارے میں سوچنا شروع کیا کہ ہم\nلوگوں کو اس کو ایک ٹول کے طور پر دیکھنے میں کس طرح مدد کریں گے اور وہ اس سے بھاگ نہیں سکتے۔ اور بنیادی طور پر جو میں نے\nسوچا تھا کہ ہونے والا ہے وہی ہوا ہے۔ سب نے سرقہ کی طرف رجوع کیا اور کیا ہم اس کو روکنے کے لیے کچھ کرنے والے ہیں؟ اور اس طرح میں اس طرح تھا، \"اوہ،\nیہاں صرف ایک سیکنڈ انتظار کرو۔\" آئیے یہ جاننے کی کوشش کرتے ہیں، سب سے پہلے، ہم جانتے تھے کہ\nChatGPT استعمال کرنے کے لیے آپ کو 18 سال کا ہونا ضروری ہے، لیکن ہم جانتے ہیں کہ یہ بچوں کو جعلی اکاؤنٹس بنانے سے نہیں روکتا۔ اور ہم جانتے تھے کہ ہمیں اس کے\nساتھ یہ مسئلہ درپیش ہے، اور ہمیں، ہمیں\nگلے لگانا ہوگا اور یہ معلوم کرنا ہوگا کہ ہم اسے کس طرح استعمال کرنے جا رہے ہیں۔ اور بالکل واضح طور پر، جو\nواقعی دلچسپ ہے، سال، یہ ہے کہ میرے پاس ایک دوسرا گریڈر تھا جس نے ایک پروجیکٹ کے لیے اپنا ری سائیکل مونسٹر بنایا، اور اس کے والد نے اس کے بارے میں کہانی لکھنے کے لیے ChatGPT پر جانے میں اس کی مدد کی۔ لہذا اگر دوسرے درجے کے طالب علم پہلے سے\nہی اسے استعمال کرنے جا رہے ہیں، تو ہمیں یہ دیکھنا ہوگا کہ یہ\nایک ایسا آلہ بننے جا رہا ہے جسے بچے گلے لگانے جا رہے ہیں۔ تو ہم انہیں کیسے سکھائیں گے کہ\nاسے اخلاقی طور پر کیسے استعمال کرنا ہے، اور یہ ان کی آواز ہے، اور اس سے بھاگنا نہیں؟ اور شروع سے ہی ہمارا موقف یہی تھا۔\n لیکن میں آپ کو بتا سکتا ہوں کہ\nاساتذہ سب ایسے ہی تھے، \"آپ اسے روکنے کے لیے کیا کرنے والے ہیں؟\" جب تک ہم نے\nاس قسم کا مکالمہ شروع نہیں کیا۔ ہم کسی ایسی چیز کو کیوں روکیں گے جو ممکنہ طور پر کسی طالب علم کی مدد کر سکے؟ ہمیں بس\nاسے استعمال کرنے کا طریقہ سیکھنا ہے، ٹھیک ہے؟ - اور آپ کیسے جواب دیتے ہیں؟ کیونکہ ان خدشات کی ایک اچھی تعداد\nحقیقی ہے۔ میں ہیومینٹیز کا استاد ہوں اور میں ٹرم پیپرز تفویض کرنے کا عادی ہوں، اور اب طلباء شاید\nChatGPT استعمال کر رہے ہوں اور وہ، آپ جانتے ہیں، مجھے لگتا ہے کہ آپ اس کا پتہ نہیں لگا سکتے۔ میں جانتا ہوں کہ ایسے لوگ ہیں جو دعوی کر رہے ہیں کہ وہ کچھ ٹیکنالوجی بنانے والے ہیں، لیکن اگر کوئی اس کے بارے میں مبہم طور پر تخلیقی ہے تو آپ واقعی اس کا پتہ نہیں لگا سکتے۔ \n آپ ان لوگوں کو کیا بتا رہے ہیں یا آپ سب نے\nضلع کے اندر پریکٹس تبدیل کرنا شروع کر دی ہے، اور ڈاکٹر بفنگٹن، آپ جاری رکھ سکتے ہیں اور پھر میں واقعی متجسس ہوں، ٹم، آپ ان مسائل کے بارے میں کیسا محسوس کرتے ہیں۔ - ٹھیک ہے، میرا مطلب ہے، میں یہ\nکہنے والا ہوں کہ انگریزی کے کچھ اساتذہ تھے، آپ تصور کر سکتے ہیں، وہ سب سے پہلے بولنے والے ہیں اور کہتے ہیں، \"واہ، وہ پولیسنگ سے باہر ہیں۔\" اور دیکھو، مجھے لگتا ہے کہ یہ\nیہ ہے اور میں نے یہ چیکر چلایا۔ اور\nاس کے بارے میں ان کا نقطہ نظر دیکھنا بہت دلچسپ تھا۔ اور ایک چیز جس پر\nمیں واقعتا یقین کرتا ہوں وہ یہ ہے کہ ہمیں\nبچوں کو چیزیں تفویض کرنے کا طریقہ بدلنا ہوگا۔ اور آپ کو\nانہیں دکھانا ہوگا اور انہیں سکھانا ہوگا کہ اس کا مناسب استعمال کیسے کریں۔ کیونکہ وہاں سمجھداری ہونی چاہیے، اخلاقی استعمال ہونا چاہیے، کیا یہ آپ کی آواز ہے یا\nکسی اور کی؟ اور آپ کیسے ثابت کرتے ہیں کہ یہ\nسچ ہے، آپ اس کا حوالہ کیسے دے رہے ہیں، اور یہ سب چیزیں۔ کیونکہ یہ ہمیں\nچیزوں کو مختلف طریقے سے دیکھنے پر مجبور کرتا ہے۔ اب، میں نہیں جانتا کہ آپ Khanmigo کے ساتھ ہمارے تجربات میں کتنی جلدی جانا چاہتے ہیں،\n لیکن میں جو کہہ سکتا ہوں وہ یہ ہے کہ\nہم نے Khanmigo کو پائلٹ کرنے سے پہلے ہی دیکھنا شروع کر دیا تھا کہ AI کا قابل قبول استعمال کیا ہوگا؟ اور اس سے پہلے کہ وہ پائلٹ شروع کریں، یہ واقعی اس بات کو یقینی بنانے کے بارے میں تھا\nکہ اس میں فہم ہے، اس بات کو یقینی بنانا کہ ہم\nآپ کی آواز کی نمائندگی کر رہے ہیں اور آپ صرف\nکسی چیز کو کاپی اور پیسٹ نہیں کر رہے ہیں۔ تو ہم نے\nشاید ایک روبرک کو دیکھنا شروع کیا جس میں AI نہیں ہے، تھوڑا سا AI، اور آپ\nاسے کس چیز کے لیے استعمال کرنے کی اجازت دیں گے؟ اور پھر، آپ جانتے ہیں، جیسے،\nمکمل اڑا ہوا AI کیسا لگتا ہے؟ اور کیا آپ اسے\nگفتگو اور بحث کے لیے استعمال کرنے جا رہے ہیں؟ لہذا ہم نے\nاس قسم کی گفتگو شروع کی تاکہ نہ صرف اس پر مکمل پابندی لگائی جائے، بلکہ اس کے بارے میں بات کریں کہ آپ کس چیز کی اجازت دیں گے۔ اور پھر مجھے لگتا ہے کہ ہم نے خانمیگو کے ساتھ جو کچھ دریافت کیا ہے اس میں ہم مزید معلومات حاصل کریں گے، لیکن یہ اس قسم کا مکالمہ ہے جو ہم نے لوگوں کے ساتھ شروع کیا۔ - انتہائی مددگار۔ اور ڈاکٹر کریگ، ان\nدونوں کے بارے میں آپ کا کیا نقطہ نظر ہے؟ \nجب آپ نے ChatGPT کو منظرعام پر آتے دیکھا تو آپ کا پہلا ردعمل کیا تھا اور\nآپ اپنے اساتذہ اور دوسروں سے\nاس پر تشریف لانے کے بارے میں کیا سنتے رہے ہیں؟ - یہ ایک بہت اچھا سوال ہے، اور یہ واقعی\nمیرے لیے بہت دلچسپ ہے کیونکہ ڈاکٹر بفنگٹن نے مجھے\nدیر سے شروع کرنے کی رہنمائی کرائی تھی، جس کا مطلب ہے کہ دیر سے آغاز ہمارے لیے، ہمارا تمام عملہ ساتھ بیٹھا ہے اور طلباء دیر سے آتے ہیں، اس لیے ہم اجتماعی\nپیشہ ورانہ ترقی۔ اور مجھے بالکل یاد نہیں ہے کہ یہ کیا تھا کہ میرے پاس عملہ\nکام کر رہا تھا، لیکن آخر میں، ہمارے انجینئرنگ کے ایک استاد\nمیرے پاس آئے اور اس نے کہا، اور یہ نومبر\n2022 کی بات ہے، اور اس نے کہا، \"ارے  میں نے سوال کا جواب دیا۔\" وہ اس طرح ہے، \"آپ اس کے بارے میں کیا سوچتے ہیں؟\" اور اس طرح میں نے اسے پڑھا اور میں نے کہا، \"اوہ، بہت اچھا کیا،\nڈینیل، یہ بہت اچھا ہے.\" اور وہ جاتا ہے، \"میں نے یہ نہیں لکھا۔\" اور میں نے کہا، \"ٹھیک ہے۔\" اور یوں یہ\nChatGPT کے ساتھ میرا پہلا حقیقی تکرار تھا جس نے اسے ریڈار پر ڈالا۔ اب، ایک\nسابقہ ​​انگلش ٹیچر ہونے کے ناطے، میں اس وقت یہ نہ کہوں گا کہ میں نے کیا کیا، ٹھیک ہے؟ ڈاکٹر بفنگٹن نے اس بارے میں بات کی، مجھے کتابیں پسند ہیں، آپ میرے پیچھے کتابیں دیکھ سکتے ہیں۔ ڈاکٹر بفنگٹن کو کتابیں پسند ہیں، ان کے پاس\nوہ سب موجود ہیں۔ میں نے تحقیق شروع کردی، ٹھیک ہے؟ اور، آپ جانتے ہیں، بالکل واضح طور پر، مجھے لگتا ہے کہ اس کے بارے میں کچھ پریشان کن ہے جسے میں\nمخفف-itis کے طور پر حوالہ دینا چاہتا ہوں، مطلب، آپ جانتے ہیں، ہمارے پاس ہر چیز کے مخفف ہیں۔ اور اس طرح، آپ جانتے ہیں،\nاس طرح کے تصور کو ختم کرتے ہوئے، وہ کیا ہے، آپ جانتے ہیں، ChatGPT\nیا جو بھی معاملہ ہو سکتا ہے۔ اور آپ یہ جاننے کے لیے آتے ہیں کہ، آپ جانتے ہیں، یہ سب کچھ AI میں شامل ہو جاتا ہے،\nٹھیک ہے؟ مصنوعی ذہانت۔ اور اس کے بعد اس قسم نے\nمجھے خرگوش کی پگڈنڈی سے نیچے لے جایا، اگر آپ چاہیں گے، آپ کو معلوم ہے کہ\nAI کیا ہے اور کیا یہ نیا ہے یا یہ\nایک مختلف تکرار میں ہے، ٹھیک ہے؟ تو مجھے اس بات کا\nکوئی اندازہ نہیں تھا کہ اس کے بعد پڑھنا کیا ہے، آپ جانتے ہیں، ملک کے\n بڑے اسکول اضلاع کے بارے میں مضامین،\nمثال کے طور پر، جو اس پر پابندی لگانے جا رہے ہیں، وغیرہ۔  اس وقت میں نے اپنے آپ سے کہا، ٹھیک ہے، آپ جانتے ہیں، یہ سمجھ میں آتا ہے۔ یہ انسانی فطرت ہے، آپ جانتے ہیں، زندہ رہنے والے، اپنے آپ کو بچانے کی کوشش کرتے ہیں، ٹھیک ہے، اور تحفظ کے ان ہیجز کو لگاتے ہیں۔ ٹھیک ہے پھر آپ جتنا زیادہ\nاس پر غور کریں گے، آپ جانتے ہیں، انگریزی کے ایک سابق استاد کی حیثیت سے، میں جانتا ہوں کہ\nان میں سے بہت ساری اصطلاحات جو ہم استعمال کرتے ہیں، مثلاً AI، وہ بہت سی بار ان\nچیزوں پر مبنی ہیں جو کہ آپ  جانتے ہیں، سائنس فکشن سے متعلق۔ میرا مطلب ہے، آپ\nAI کو واپس دیکھتے ہیں اور، آپ جانتے ہیں، یہ \"The Wizard of Oz\" کی طرح ہے۔ تم جانتے ہو، ٹن مین، ٹھیک ہے؟ جیسے، کیا یہ ممکن ہے، آپ جانتے ہیں، کہ میرے پاس کوئی وجود ہو سکتا ہے، اگر آپ چاہیں، تو یہ تخلیق شدہ چیز جو استدلال کر سکتی ہے، ٹھیک ہے؟ اور اس لیے یہ اتنا دلکش ہے،\nجیسے ایک بے دل ٹن مین، ٹھیک ہے، اور مصنوعی طور پر ذہین روبوٹس کا تصور۔\n اور آپ پیچھے مڑ کر دیکھیں اور\nیہ کوئی نئی بات نہیں ہے، یہ ایک مختلف تکرار پر لیا گیا ہے جیسا کہ ٹیکنالوجی نے پکڑ لیا ہے۔ اور اس طرح، آپ جانتے ہیں، میں نے\nاس پر غور کرنا شروع کیا اور میں اس طرح ہوں، \"اوہ میرے خدا۔\" آپ جانتے ہیں، 1950 کی دہائی میں، آپ جانتے ہیں، اس کے بارے میں بات کی جا رہی تھی، ٹھیک ہے؟ اور اس طرح فلسفی\nاس کو دریافت کرنے کی کوشش کر رہے تھے اور وہاں ایک تھا، مجھے\nاس لڑکے کا نام یاد نہیں ہے، لیکن ایک برطانوی ریاضی دان جس نے امکان پیدا کرنے کی کوشش کی،\nآپ جانتے ہیں، کیا اس کا کوئی ثبوت ہے۔\n- ایلن ٹیورنگ۔ - ہاں. اور یہ ایسا ہی تھا، آپ یہ\nسارے افسانے میں دیکھتے ہیں، آپ جانتے ہیں۔ ایک چھوٹی سی کہانی جسے\n\"سب سے خطرناک کھیل\" کہا جاتا ہے۔ اور، آپ جانتے ہیں،\nجانوروں اور انسانوں کو دیکھتے ہوئے اور\nتفریق کرنے والے کے طور پر استدلال کرنے کی صلاحیت۔ اور اس طرح، آپ جانتے ہیں، مسئلہ یہ\nتھا، جیسا کہ ہم سب جانتے ہیں، آپ جانتے ہیں، ٹیکنالوجی تیار نہیں تھی،\nآپ جانتے ہیں، اس وقت۔ اور اس طرح آپ اسے مصنوعی ذہانت کے پورے تصور کی طرح دیکھتے ہیں جو ابھی\nدہائیوں کی تبدیلیوں سے گزرا ہے، ٹھیک ہے؟ یہ ایک رولر کوسٹر کی طرح تھا۔ یہ اوپر اور نیچے اور تمام جگہ پر تھا. اور اس طرح، آپ جانتے ہیں، کہ\nپھر ظاہر ہے کہ ہم موجودہ دور کی طرف لے گئے، جہاں ٹیکنالوجی برقرار رہ سکتی ہے، ٹھیک ہے؟ اور اس لیے اب ہم اسے\nواقعی سماجی تبدیلی کی طرح دیکھتے ہیں جہاں اچانک\nانجینئرنگ کے استاد اس چیز کو استعمال کر رہے ہیں، لیکن میں یہ\nبھی نہیں جانتا کہ یہ کیا ہے، آپ جانتے ہیں، مخفف-itis، ChatGPT۔ اور تم کیا کرتے ہو؟ آپ نے اپنے\nتحفظ کے باڑے لگائے، ٹھیک ہے؟ جیسے، میں نہیں جانتا کہ یہ کیا\nہے اور یہ خوفناک ہے، ٹھیک ہے؟ اور اس لیے میں سمجھتا ہوں کہ اس وقت تک\nسب سے اہم بات یہ تھی، آپ جانتے ہیں، جیسے ہی ہماری وہ\nگفتگو ہوئی، آپ جانتے ہیں، پھر ڈاکٹر بفنگٹن کی طرح،\nبطور رہنما، وہ اس بارے میں پہلے ہی جانتی تھیں۔ مجھے پارٹی میں دیر ہوئی، ٹھیک ہے؟ لیکن پھر ہم\nمل کر مسئلہ حل کرنا شروع کرتے ہیں اور سوچتے ہیں اور دریافت کرتے ہیں۔ اور میں سمجھتا ہوں کہ\nاس ضلع کو کیا چیز منفرد بناتی ہے اور کیوں ہم\nخان کے ساتھ شراکت داری کو اہمیت دیتے ہیں اور مجھے کیوں لگتا ہے کہ ہم اس\nوقت آپ کے ساتھ ہیں صرف اس وجہ سے کہ آپ جانتے ہیں کہ\n\"بہادر نئے الفاظ\" کے بارے میں بات ہے۔ آپ جانتے ہیں، ڈاکٹر بفنگٹن ایک ٹریل بلیزر ہیں اور وہ چیزوں کو غیر بائنری انداز میں دیکھنے سے نہیں ڈرتی، ٹھیک ہے؟ ہو یا نہ ہو، اچھا یا برا۔ سرمئی علاقوں کے بارے میں کیا ہے، ٹھیک ہے؟ اور یہ کیلکولیٹر کی طرح ٹولز ہیں۔ آپ\nنئے ڈیجیٹل SAT میں ہونے والی تبدیلیوں کو دیکھتے ہیں، آپ جانتے ہیں۔ ان کے پاس ڈیسموس\nانفیوزڈ کیلکولیٹر ہے یعنی کیلکولیٹر کے نئے SAT\nیا کوئی کیلکولیٹر سیکشن کے لیے اب ایسی کوئی چیز نہیں ہے۔ ٹھیک ہے، یہ اس کی حقیقت ہے کہ ہم کہاں ہیں، اور یہ ضروری نہیں ہے کہ\nاگر ہم ڈاکٹر بفنگٹن کے نقطہ نظر کے مطابق،\nاپنے عملے اور طلباء کے ساتھ مل کر ان وسائل کے ذہین ذمہ دار بننے کے لیے کام کر سکتے ہیں، تو یہ ضروری نہیں ہے کہ وہ ڈسٹوپین ہو۔  تبدیلی، ٹھیک ہے؟ اور اس لیے میں اپنے لیے سوچتا ہوں، آپ جانتے ہیں، ڈاکٹر بفنگٹن اپنے\nمقالے میں، آپ جانتے ہیں، آپ\nاصطلاحات کی تعریف کس چیز سے شروع کرتے ہیں؟ اور اس طرح جب آپ چیزوں کی تحقیق کرنا شروع کرتے ہیں، تو آپ کو احساس ہونے لگتا ہے، کیا ہم بھی\nاسی چیز کے بارے میں بات کر رہے ہیں، ٹھیک ہے؟ کیا ہم اپنی اصطلاحات کی وضاحت کر رہے ہیں یا ہم صرف ان\n چیزوں کے بارے میں ادھر ادھر ادھر ادھر گھوم رہے ہیں جن کی ہمیں\nسمجھ بھی نہیں آتی کہ وہ کیا ہیں؟ ٹھیک ہے؟ - ٹھیک ہے، کیا میں\nوہاں صرف ایک سیکنڈ کے لیے چھلانگ لگا سکتا ہوں، کیونکہ ایک چیز، ایک ٹیکنالوجی صارف کے طور پر،\nدن میں، 80 کی دہائی میں، آپ کو معلوم ہے، اور میں نے\nایپل کمپیوٹر کے ساتھ تدریسی ڈیزائن میں اپنی انٹرنشپ کی، اور  ، آپ جانتے ہیں، اور آپ یہ جاننے کی کوشش کر رہے ہیں کہ آپ اساتذہ کو\nٹیکنالوجی کو اپنانے کے لیے کیسے تیار کرتے ہیں، اس سے خوفزدہ نہ ہوں۔ اور آپ کو واقعی اپنے آپ سے کہنا پڑے گا، نمبر ایک چیز جو\nوہ جاننا چاہتے ہیں، یہ میرے کام کو کیسے بہتر بنائے گا؟ یہ میرے طلباء کی مدد کیسے کرے گا؟ اور اگر آپ انہیں اس پر فروخت نہیں کر سکتے ہیں، تو آپ اسے بھول بھی سکتے ہیں۔ اور پھر، اگر آپ انہیں بیچ سکتے ہیں کہ یہ ان کے کام کو بہتر بنائے گا اور\nان کے طلباء کے لیے کامیابی کو مزید قابل رسائی بنائے گا، اور وہ اس کے ساتھ ساتھ ہیں، تو آپ کو انہیں اس کا استعمال کرنے کا طریقہ سکھانے کے لیے ایک اچھا منصوبہ بنانا ہوگا۔  . اور اس لیے جو میں واقعتا محسوس کرتا ہوں، اس کے \nبارے میں بہت پرجوش ہونے والی پہلی چیزوں میں سے ایک یہ ہے کہ جب آپ ان سے اس کے بارے میں بات کرنا شروع کرتے ہیں، کیا صرف ایک اکاؤنٹ بنانا ہے، ٹھیک ہے؟ آپ جاننا چاہتے ہیں کہ\nبہترین کاربونارا کیسے بنایا جائے؟ وہ سوال پوچھیں، ٹھیک ہے،\nاور دیکھیں کہ آپ کو کیا ملتا ہے۔ اور وہ اس کی طرف متوجہ ہیں. یہ اس طرح کی طرح ہے جیسے پہلی بار سرچ انجن کا استعمال کرتے ہوئے، اور آپ ان\nتمام کامیابیوں کے ساتھ آتے ہیں اور پھر آپ کہتے ہیں، \"ٹھیک ہے،\nآپ کو جو چاہیں حاصل کرنے کے لیے اسے بہتر کرنا ہوگا۔\" تو آپ سوال دوبارہ پیدا کر سکتے ہیں، ٹھیک ہے؟ اور اس لیے انہیں یہ چھوٹی چھوٹی\nچیزیں دلچسپ لگتی ہیں، اور پھر آپ انہیں یہ چیزیں دکھانے کے لیے اضافی چھوٹے اقدامات کرتے ہیں جیسے کہ\nایگزٹ ٹکٹ کیسے بنایا جائے۔ اور پھر وہ\nتھوڑا سا استعمال دیکھنا شروع کر رہے ہیں اور وہ جا رہے ہیں، \"واہ!\" تو ایک معاملہ، انجینئرنگ کے استاد جو\nڈاکٹر کریگ سے بات کر رہے تھے، وہ سامنے آتا ہے اور وہ اس طرح ہے، \"واہ، میں نے ابھی ابھی اپنی ہوبارٹ ایجوکیشنل فاؤنڈیشن کی گرانٹ کی ہے، اور میں نے یہ سب ChatGPT میں لکھا ہے۔\" اور یقیناً اسے اس سے نوازا گیا۔ اسے اندر جانا پڑا اور کچھ چیزوں کو موافقت کرنا پڑا، اور وہ اس طرح ہے، \"یہ حیرت انگیز تھا۔\" اور ہم پسند کرتے ہیں، ٹھیک ہے، بہت اچھا کام، آپ کو اس کا فائدہ ملا۔ میرا ڈائریکٹر آف ٹیکنالوجی\nاور میرا آئی ٹی پرسن، ہمارا اسٹوڈنٹ مینجمنٹ سسٹم، رپورٹ میں کچھ ٹھیک کام نہیں کر رہا تھا جو انہیں کرنا تھا۔ وہ پچھلے سرے میں پیچھے چلے گئے اور کچھ کوڈ جو ان کے خیال میں غلط تھا، اور انہوں نے اسے ChatGPT میں ڈال دیا\n، اور پھر یہ واپس آیا اور اسے درست کر دیا۔ وہ اسے درست کرنے کے قابل تھے،\nاور انہوں نے کہا، \"واہ!\" ہمارے فوڈ سروس ڈائریکٹر، کسی ایسی چیز کو دیکھتے ہوئے جو انہیں فیڈرل رپورٹ کے لیے کرنا تھا، باہر گئے اور\nChatGPT میں کچھ چیزیں کر رہے تھے۔ اب، جیسا کہ ہم سب جانتے ہیں، یہ سب کچھ\nختم نہیں ہے۔ انہیں اب بھی چیزوں کو چیک کرنا ہے اور سمجھداری ہے، ٹھیک ہے؟ تو بات یہ ہے کہ،\nجب آپ اسے متعارف کروا رہے ہیں، چاہے یہ شرائط ہوں یا کچھ بھی، اگر آپ کوئی بڑا فائدہ نہیں دکھا سکتے، تو آپ کو بند کر دیا جائے گا۔ اور پھر میں سمجھتا ہوں کہ اس کا دوسرا پہلو اساتذہ کو پڑھانا ہے جب وہ\nاس کے وسائل کے پہلو کو دیکھتے ہیں، کیونکہ، بالکل واضح طور پر، وسائل کا پہلو\nاساتذہ کے لیے واقعی بہت اچھا ہوتا ہے جب وہ اسے دیکھنا شروع کرتے ہیں، میں اس قسم کی اسائنمنٹس کو کیسے بناؤں جو اس قسم کو استعمال کریں۔  ٹیکنالوجی کی؟ آپ جانتے ہیں، اور میں\nاس داستان کے بارے میں سوچتا ہوں، اس مضمون کے بارے میں، اور، آپ کو معلوم ہے، جب میں\n21ویں صدی کی مہارتوں کے بارے میں سوچتا ہوں جس میں کسی ٹیم کے ساتھ تعاون کرنا اور اس طرح کی گفتگو\nاور بحث و مباحثہ ہوتا ہے، تو آپ جانتے ہیں، مصنوعی\nذہانت آپ کو کیا بتاتی ہے؟ اور پھر آپ دوبارہ تخلیق کرتے ہیں\nاور آپ کو ایک اور جواب اور دوسرا جواب ملتا ہے،\nاور آپ اس ٹیم میں ہوتے ہیں اور آپ اس بات پر بحث اور\nبحث کر رہے ہوتے ہیں کہ کیا درست ہے، کیا حقیقی ہے، کیا ممکن ہے، اور پھر آپ کسی قسم کی مفروضہ یا\nتھیمیٹک وضع کرنا شروع کر رہے ہیں۔  صورتحال کی قسم جہاں آپ اس پر توسیع کرنے والے ہیں۔ میں سمجھتا ہوں کہ اس میں بڑی صلاحیت ہے، جب ہم لوگوں کو یہ سکھاتے ہیں کہ\nاسے مناسب طریقے سے کیسے استعمال کیا جائے۔ اور ہمیں مستقبل کی طرف دیکھنا ہے اور کہنا ہے، وہ یہ کرنے جا رہے ہیں۔ عالمی سطح پر ہمارے حریف\nاسے استعمال کرنے جا رہے ہیں۔ دنیا میں ہم کسی چیز پر پابندی کیوں لگائیں گے؟ اور پھر وہ\nحقیقی دنیا میں جائیں گے اور اسے استعمال کریں گے۔ لہٰذا ہمارا کام ہے کہ ہم اسے استعمال کریں اور اسے اچھی طرح استعمال کریں۔ انہیں اخلاقی استعمال سکھائیں، انہیں سکھائیں کہ حتمی مصنوعات حاصل کرنے کے لیے اسے حکمت عملی کے ساتھ کیسے استعمال کیا جائے۔ تو میں سمجھتا ہوں کہ ہمارے اساتذہ کو\nاس قسم کی مدد کی ضرورت ہے۔ اور اس طرح آپ شروع کرتے ہیں، بطور استاد اس سے مجھے کیا فائدہ ہوتا ہے؟ اور اب، میں\nاسے اپنے بچوں کے ساتھ کیسے استعمال کروں گا؟ اور لڑکا کیا میرے پاس ہے، آپ جانتے ہیں،\nمیرے پاس کچھ بہت اچھے خیالات ہیں کہ ہم اسے بچوں کے ساتھ کیسے استعمال کر سکتے ہیں،\nبس، مجھے اس کا کوچنگ پہلو پسند ہے، مجھے تفریق پسند ہے، لیکن یہ خانمیگو کی طرف زیادہ ہے، اور میں  جانتی ہوں کہ آپ\nہمارے ساتھ اس تک پہنچنے والے ہیں، کیونکہ میں خانمیگو سے محبت کرتا ہوں۔ میں صرف کہہ رہا ہوں۔ - نہیں، میرا مطلب ہے، میں ظاہر ہے،\nمیں متعصب ہوں، میں خانمیگو سے محبت کرتا ہوں، لیکن جب بھی میں آپ سے بات کرتا ہوں، ڈاکٹر بفنگٹن میں اس کے بارے میں زیادہ پرجوش ہو جاتا ہوں۔ اور، آپ جانتے ہیں، سننے والوں کے لیے، اساتذہ کی کئی خصوصیات ڈاکٹر بفنگٹن کے براہ راست خیالات ہیں۔ لہذا آپ کی رائے\nیقینی طور پر ہمارے پروڈکٹ میں ظاہر ہو رہی ہے۔ لیکن آئیے اس کی طرف گیئرز کو تبدیل کریں، کیونکہ ہوبارٹ پہلے سے ہی ایک ایسا ضلع تھا جو کافی مصروف تھا،\nاستعمال میں بہت زیادہ مصروف تھا، آئیے اسے پری AI خان اکیڈمی کہتے ہیں۔ پھر ہم نے آپ سب کو\nKhanmigo کے ابتدائی ڈیمو دکھائے، اور مارچ کے بعد سے، آپ سب ملک کے\nپہلے اضلاع میں سے ایک ہیں ، شاید\nدنیا میں، ایک منظم طریقے سے Khanmigo کو استعمال کرنے کے لیے، اور ایسا لگتا ہے کہ یہ\nنتیجہ خیز ہے۔  خانمیگو پر آپ سب کا اصل\nردعمل کیا تھا؟ \nاس کے لیے آپ کے پاس اب بھی کون سے سوالات یا خواہشات ہیں؟ اور پچھلے کئی مہینوں میں کیسا تجربہ رہا ہے؟ میں آپ سے شروع کروں گا، ڈاکٹر بفنگٹن، اور پھر ڈاکٹر کریگ کے پاس جاؤں گا۔ - ٹھیک ہے، مجھے\nایک طالب علم میں اعتماد کا پہلو پسند ہے، ٹھیک ہے؟ تو میرا مطلب ہے، جو کچھ بھی آپ طالب علم کی کامیابی پر پڑھنا چاہتے ہیں اس کا آغاز اس اعتماد کے ساتھ کرنا ہوگا جو ان کے اندر ہے، کہ وہ جانتے ہیں کہ وہ یہ کر سکتے ہیں۔ اور اس لیے ہمارا کام اس بات کو یقینی بنانا ہے کہ ہم انہیں ایسی مہارتوں سے آراستہ کر رہے ہیں جو وہ خود کو ظاہر کر سکیں اور اس اعتماد کی سطح حاصل کر سکیں۔ اور ان چیزوں میں سے ایک جو کووڈ سے پہلے کی تھی، اور پھر آپ ابھی\nCOVID کی طرف بڑھ سکتے ہیں، یہ ہے کہ آپ نے ابھی یہ محسوس کرنا شروع کیا ہے کہ بچے واقعی سوالات نہیں پوچھ رہے ہیں۔ وہ ہاتھ نہیں اٹھانا چاہتے۔ اور پھر آپ\nاستاد ہیں جو کھینچنے کی کوشش کر رہے ہیں، آپ درخواست کر رہے ہیں، آپ\nہکس لے کر آ رہے ہیں، آپ بچوں کو مشغول کرنے کی کوشش کر رہے ہیں۔ یہ مشکل ہے۔ اور پھر بھی میں ایک ایلیمنٹری اسکول جا سکتا ہوں اور میں\nبچوں کو Chromebook، ایک آئی پیڈ، جو کچھ بھی کرتے دیکھتا ہوں؟ وہ خود بخود\nباہر جا رہے ہیں، مائیکروفون کو مار رہے ہیں، \"مجھے ایک نیلا سانپ دکھائیں اور\nمجھے بتائیں کہ یہ نیلا کیوں ہے۔\" ٹھیک ہے؟ اور وہ اس قسم کی چیزیں پسند کرتے ہیں۔ اور اس لیے وہ\nاپنے آلے سے بات کرنے کے لیے بہت موزوں ہیں اور وہ اس ردعمل کو پسند کرتے ہیں جو انھیں ملتا ہے، اور پھر یہ انھیں\nاس سے پوچھنے اور اس کے ساتھ کچھ زیادہ مخصوص ہونے کے لیے کچھ زیادہ پرجوش بناتا ہے۔ لہذا خانمیگو کے ساتھ یہ دیکھنے کے بارے میں جو چیزیں مجھے پسند ہیں وہ \nہے صرف وہ ٹیوٹر، وہ گائیڈ ہے، اور بچے ڈیوائس سے سوال پوچھنے سے نہیں ڈرتے ہیں۔\n اور مجھے لگتا ہے کہ یہ ذہین ہے کیونکہ وہ\nسارا دن بیٹھ کر سوالات کرتے رہیں گے۔ اور اگر ان کے پاس کوئی\nاسائنمنٹ ہے جو تیار ہے، اور آئیے صرف یہ کہتے ہیں کہ یہ تحریری مضمون ہے۔ اور، تم جانتے ہو، سال، جب میں نے پہلی بار تم سے پہلی بات کی تھی، تو تم اس پر ٹوٹ پڑو گے، لیکن تم اپنے بیٹے کے بارے میں بات کر رہے تھے کہ مضمون لکھنا ہے، ٹھیک ہے؟ اور اس طرح میرے پاس صرف پانچ اساتذہ تھے\nجو اس کو پائلٹ کر رہے تھے، لیکن پھر بھی میں اس کے بارے میں بہت پرجوش ہوں، میں اس کے بارے میں سب سے بات کر رہا ہوں، ٹھیک ہے؟ میں اس طرح ہوں، \"آپ یقین نہیں کریں گے\nجو سلمان خان نے ہمیں دکھایا۔\" اور پھر میرے پاس ایک طالب علم تھا\nجسے میں مڈل اسکول میں رہنمائی کر رہا تھا، اور وہ اس طرح ہے، \"ڈاکٹر بفنگٹن، کیا وہ\nAI چیزیں ابھی تک تیار ہیں؟\" کیونکہ اسے تحریری کوچ کی ضرورت تھی، ٹھیک ہے؟ اور اس طرح میں، ٹھیک ہے، میں خانمیگو کی طرح AI ہونے کا بہانہ کروں گا، اور میں نے کہا، \"میں آپ کا لکھنے کا کوچ بنوں گا۔\" اور میں پوچھنے کا بہانہ کرنے کی کوشش کر رہا تھا، میں ایک سوال کا اشارہ کروں گا جیسے میں سوچوں گا کہ AI کرے گا، اور یہ نہیں کہ میں نے\nآپ کے خانمیگو، سال کی جگہ لے لی ہے۔ لیکن یہاں میں آپ کو بتا سکتا ہوں۔ اس نے اسرار پر ایک چھ پیراگراف مضمون لکھا،\n اور یہ خوبصورت تھا۔ اسے صرف سوالات پوچھنے\nاور جوابات حاصل کرنے، اور اسے تھوڑا سا آگے بڑھانے میں اس اضافی مدد کی ضرورت تھی۔ اور یہ خوبصورت تھا۔ اور ان چیزوں میں سے ایک جو فیڈ بیک، جو ہمارے اساتذہ نے ہمیں بتایا، جب میں دستیاب نہ ہوں تو ٹیوٹر\nیا اسسٹنٹ یا کوچ رکھنا کتنا اچھا ہے ؟ اور وہ اس سے محبت کرتے تھے\nکیونکہ وہ دیکھتے ہیں ان کے، اور یہ ہائی اسکول کے\nاساتذہ ہیں جنہوں نے کہا، میں صبح دو بجے نہیں اٹھتا ہوں جب وہ مائن کرافٹ کھیل چکے ہیں اور انہوں نے\nاپنا پیپر لکھنا شروع کرنے کا فیصلہ کیا اور عروج پر، ان کے پاس ایک درس ہے۔  اسسٹنٹ، اور وہ سوالات پوچھ رہے ہیں\nاور وہ اسکول آتے ہیں اور وہ اپنے کام میں پراعتماد محسوس کرتے ہیں۔ اور اس لیے مجھے لگتا ہے کہ یہی\nاس کی خوبصورتی ہے۔ اب، میں اب بھی\nآپ کے معلم کے طور پر واپس آؤں گا اور اس بات کو یقینی بناؤں گا کہ آپ نے\nدرخواست دی ہے اور یہ آپ کی آواز ہے، اور آپ اس کی نمائندگی کر رہے ہیں\nجو میں نے آپ کو تفویض کیا ہے۔ لیکن واہ،\nبچوں میں اعتماد کی سطح حیرت انگیز ہے۔ اور میں اس کے بارے میں یہی پسند کرتا ہوں۔ کسی بھی وقت آپ کے پاس اس\nوقت اور وہاں ٹیوٹر ہوسکتا ہے، اور مجھے لگتا ہے کہ یہ\nاس کا بہترین حصہ ہے۔ مجھے لگتا ہے کہ جو تاثرات ہم آپ کو دینے میں کامیاب رہے ہیں، کہ آپ نے پروگرام کو اور بھی بہتر بنایا ہے، کیا پوری چیٹ کی تاریخ ہے، ٹھیک ہے؟ لہذا میں دیکھ سکتا ہوں کہ آپ نے کتنی دیر تک مصروفیت کی ہے، آپ کس قسم کے سوالات پوچھ رہے ہیں، اور یہ صرف ایک جلدی کام نہیں ہے کہ اس طرح کی کاپی پیسٹ کر لیں۔ آپ واقعی وہاں موجود ہیں\nفہم کا استعمال کرتے ہوئے، بہتر بنانے، اور صحیح سوالات پوچھتے ہوئے کام کا ایک بہت بڑا حصہ بدلنے کے لیے۔ میں اس کے بارے میں اس سے محبت کرتا ہوں. سوال کرنا، سبق دینا،\nاعتماد پیدا کرنا۔ ہم اپنے طلباء کے لیے یہی چاہتے ہیں۔ - آپ جانتے ہیں، میں\nوہاں دو واقعی طاقتور تھیمز سنتا ہوں۔ ایک\nاس کا اعتماد سازی کا پہلو ہے، جو خود شناسی پر\nپوری دنیا کو سمجھتا ہے۔ اگر طلباء\nمزید پراعتماد ہو سکتے ہیں اور اپنے سوالات کے جوابات حاصل کر سکتے ہیں، تو\nوہ مزید مشغول ہوں گے۔ اور پھر دوسرا،\nجس کا آپ نے ابھی اشارہ کیا، جو صرف آؤٹ پٹ پر عمل ہے۔ اور یہ کہ، AI، دلچسپ بات یہ ہے کہ میرے خیال میں، ہمیں اس عمل میں ایک عینک فراہم کرتا ہے\nجو ہمارے پاس پہلے کبھی نہیں تھا، کیونکہ آپ یہ نہیں دیکھ پائیں گے کہ\nایک طالب علم صبح دو بجے کیا کر رہا ہے جب\nوہ اپنا مضمون لکھ رہے ہیں، اور وہ  ہو سکتا ہے کہ\nان کی بڑی بہن کو یہ ان کے لیے لکھنے کے لیے\nیا اس طرح کی کوئی چیز ہو۔ اور اب آپ کو ایک عینک مل جائے گی۔ ڈاکٹر کریگ، اپنے بارے میں کیا خیال ہے؟ آپ جانتے ہیں، خانمیگو کے بارے میں آپ کا\nابتدائی ردعمل کیا تھا، خاص طور پر\nChatGPT کے بارے میں آپ کا ردعمل، اور اب تک کا تجربہ کیسا رہا؟ - یہ ایک بہت اچھا سوال ہے. آپ جانتے ہیں، بالکل واضح طور پر،\nجب آپ جانتے ہیں، کہ آپ تمام\nطرح کی ورکشاپس میں جا سکتے ہیں اور کتابیں پڑھ سکتے ہیں اور،\nآپ جانتے ہیں، یہ مددگار ہے۔ یہ آپ کو ایک چنگاری دیتا ہے۔ لیکن، آپ جانتے ہیں، یہ ایسا ہی ہے،\nمیں اس چنگاری کو کیسے لے سکتا ہوں اور واقعی اس چنگاری کو ایک نامیاتی فطرت کی طرح اس تک لے جانے کی اجازت دیتا ہوں، جہاں یہ آپ کے کام کرنے کے طریقے میں سرایت کر جاتی ہے، ٹھیک ہے؟ ہم ثقافت کے بارے میں بات کرتے ہیں،\nہم آب و ہوا کے بارے میں بات کرتے ہیں. اور میں ایسی چیزیں دیکھتا ہوں جیسے، آپ\nجانتے ہیں، ایکویٹی اور رسائی اور، آپ جانتے ہیں، ہم سیکھنے کے نقصان کے بارے میں بات کرتے ہیں\nاور ہم اس کے بارے میں بات کرتے ہیں، آپ جانتے ہیں، میتھیو کا اثر کیسے ہوتا ہے، ٹھیک ہے؟  حاصل کرنے والوں کے پاس ہوتا رہتا ہے\nاور نہ رکھنے والوں کے پاس نہیں ہوتا۔ ہم اس خلا میں کیسے پہنچیں گے اور واقعی مواقع فراہم کریں گے؟ میں کل ایک ساتھی کے ساتھ ایک ورکشاپ میں تھا،\n اور ہم\nنئے ڈیجیٹل SAT کو دیکھ رہے تھے، اور میرے ساتھی، جو ایک\nمعلم اور اس میں شامل والدین ہیں، اس نے کہا، \"ٹھیک ہے، آپ جانتے ہیں، میں\nاپنی بیٹی کے ساتھ کام کر رہی تھی اور، آپ  جانتی ہوں، وہ یہ، وہ اور دوسری بات نہیں سمجھ سکی۔\" اور اس طرح، آپ جانتے ہیں، میں اس طرح ہوں،\nٹھیک ہے، ہم آپ کو ایک ٹیوٹر حاصل کر سکتے ہیں، آپ جانتے ہیں، اور دہ، دہ، دہ، دہ، دہ۔ اور اس نے مجھے\nدوبارہ اس کے بارے میں سوچنے پر مجبور کیا، کیونکہ ایسا ہی ہے، خانمیگو کا کیا ہوگا؟ ٹھیک ہے، ہم، آپ کی بات،\nاور ڈاکٹر بفنگٹن کی بات تک، آپ جانتے ہیں،\nخان اکیڈمی کے ٹریک پر ہم کافی عرصے سے ہیں۔ میں نے اسے طالب علم کے نقطہ نظر سے، استاد کے نقطہ نظر سے، اور\nاب، خان اضلاع کے ذریعے، انتظامی نقطہ نظر سے استعمال کیا ہے۔ لیکن میں خانمیگو کے ساتھ جو کچھ دیکھ رہا ہوں وہ لوگوں کے خیالات کو لے جانے کی صلاحیت ہے\n اور اسے وہاں تک پہنچانا ہے جہاں یہ نظامی ہے۔ اور اس لیے مجھے لگتا ہے کہ جیسے جیسے ہم\n روٹ میموری سے مزید دور ہوتے جائیں گے، اور آپ کو\nلکیریں دھندلی نظر آنے لگتی ہیں۔ میرا مطلب ہے، ہمارے طلباء\nتخلیق کار ہیں، وہ پروڈیوسر ہیں، وہ نغمہ نگار ہیں، وہ گلوکار ہیں، وہ پوڈ کاسٹر ہیں، ٹھیک ہے؟ وہ کیوریٹر ہیں، وہ میڈیا اور معلومات کے صارفین ہیں،\nلیکن وہ اسے تخلیق بھی کر رہے ہیں۔ اور تو یہ سب کچھ کیا لیتا ہے؟ یہ علم کی بڑھتی ہوئی گہرائی،\nپیچیدگی، مواد کے ساتھ بات چیت لیتا ہے، ٹھیک ہے؟ تصورات کے ساتھ تعامل، وغیرہ۔ ٹھیک ہے، مسئلہ یہ ہے کہ، اگر آپ\nمیتھیو اثر کے بارے میں سوچتے ہیں اور، آپ کو معلوم ہے کہ، سماجی اور ثقافتی طور پر\nکچھ حالات کی صلاحیت، جس کے تحت وہ خلا کو پُر کرنے، ان کی شناخت کرنے اور انہیں فنڈ دینے کے قابل ہیں، تو\nباقی سب کا کیا ہوگا؟ ان لوگوں کے بارے میں کیا جو اس قسم کی چیزوں تک رسائی نہیں رکھتے؟ اور یہاں تک کہ اگر وہ کرتے ہیں، تو\nکیا ہوگا اگر یہ کام نہیں کر رہا ہے؟ اور اس لیے ہم سب کچھ سنتے ہیں، آپ جانتے ہیں، طالب علم کی بے حسی اور مصروفیت کی کمی\nاور، آپ جانتے ہیں، جو بھی معاملہ ہے، اور\nیہ وہ سوال ہے جو میں پوچھوں گا۔ میں کہوں گا، ٹھیک ہے، آئیے صرف یہ کہتے ہیں کہ ہم\nآپ کے طلباء کی توجہ حاصل کرتے ہیں۔ آپ کے دل موہ لینے والے سامعین ہیں۔ تم اس کے ساتھ کیا کرنے والے ہو؟ آئیے اس پر اسکرپٹ پلٹائیں، ٹھیک ہے؟ اور اس لیے میں سوچتا ہوں کہ میرے لیے کیا دلچسپ ہے، جیسا کہ ہم Khanmigo کے اس بیٹا موڈ کو استعمال کر رہے ہیں، اور جیسا کہ ہم\nاس کا مشاہدہ کر رہے ہیں، آپ طالب علموں کو علم اور تصورات کے ساتھ اس طرح تعامل کرتے ہوئے دیکھ رہے ہیں جو ان کے کام کی پیچیدگی کو بڑھا رہا ہے۔  . اور یہ کوئی بات چیت نہیں ہے، یہ ایک نہیں ہے، اسے ڈالنے کا بہترین طریقہ\nایک لین دین ہوگا، ٹھیک ہے؟ یہ صرف ایک نہیں ہے، ٹھیک ہے، مجھے\nاس کی ضرورت ہے، تم مجھے وہ دو۔ یہ ایک جاری رشتہ ہے جس کے تحت طالب علم\nنئے مواد کے ساتھ تعامل کر رہے ہیں، یا خود کو چیلنج کر رہے ہیں، یا اس بات کو بڑھا رہے ہیں جسے وہ\nسچ سمجھتے ہیں۔ اور سیکھنے کا یہ دوبارہ داخلہ وہی ہے جس کے بارے میں ہم سب پرجوش ہیں، ٹھیک ہے؟ اس لیے ہم یہاں اس بارے میں بہت بات کرتے ہیں، آپ جانتے ہیں، ہم کس طرح\nجذبات، مقصد، امکانات، وغیرہ کے ساتھ شادی کرنے کے طریقے تلاش کرتے ہیں۔ اور اس لیے جب میں خانمیگو کو دیکھتا ہوں،\nڈاکٹر بفنگٹن کے نقطہ نظر کے مطابق، اگر میں ایک استاد ہوں، تو یہ\nآپ کے لیے پڑھانا نہیں ہے، ٹھیک ہے؟ لیکن یہ کیا کر سکتا ہے؟ اس سے علم کو تازہ کرنے میں مدد مل سکتی ہے۔ یہ، آپ جانتے ہیں، ہکس بنانے کے لیے\nاستاد کے ساتھ تخلیق اور شراکت داری کر سکتا ہے ، ٹھیک ہے؟ یہ\nان کے ساتھ ایگزٹ ٹکٹ بنا کر استاد کی مدد کر سکتا ہے۔ اس سے سبق کی منصوبہ بندی میں مدد مل سکتی ہے۔ یہ دے سکتا ہے، آپ جانتے ہیں، یہاں\nتک کہ ایک صاف ستھرا خصوصیت ہے جہاں آپ پورا سبق لے سکتے ہیں اور یہ اسے ایک\nتفریحی چھوٹی نظم میں بدل دیتا ہے، ٹھیک ہے؟ آپ روبرکس کو مل کر بنا سکتے ہیں،\nاس قسم کی تمام چیزیں، ٹھیک ہے؟ سیکھنے کے مقاصد، اسے ڈاکٹر بفنگٹن کی بات کے لیے ایک ٹول کے طور پر استعمال کریں۔ اور پھر، سیکھنے والے کی طرف۔  آگے بڑھو۔ - اس کا مطلب میرا مطلب ہے، پائلٹ کے دوران کچھ\nانتہائی دلچسپ چیزیں جو\nانہیں پتہ چل رہی تھیں کہ آپ کسی ادبی شخصیت سے بات کر سکتے ہیں۔ اوہ میرے خدا! یا آپ کسی سے\nتاریخی طور پر بات کر سکتے ہیں اور پھر آپ ہیں، اس نے انہیں لمحے میں ڈال دیا اور اس نے سیکھنے کو زندگی بخشی۔ اور اس طرح یہ بہت پرکشش ہے۔ آپ جانتے ہیں، جب میں سوچتا ہوں\n، برسوں سے ہم نے کہا ہے، تفریق، آپ جانتے ہیں، یہ\nخان اکیڈمی کی بڑی چیزوں میں سے ایک تھا۔ اور جیسا کہ آپ نے کہا ہے، اور\nجیسا کہ ڈاکٹر کریگ نے کہا ہے، ہم خان اکیڈمی استعمال کر رہے تھے،\nہم ابتدائی اختیار کرنے والے تھے۔ مجھے یہ پسند آیا۔ ہماری اپنی تھی، ہم نے اپنی\nخان اکیڈمی ڈکشنری بھی بنائی تھی، یہ کافی مضحکہ خیز تھی، اسے استعمال کرنے کا طریقہ۔ لیکن مجھے اس میں کیا پسند آیا؟ مجھے پسند آیا کہ تفریق تھی۔  اس طرف وہ گائیڈ تھا\n، کچھ اضافی مدد، ٹھیک ہے؟ اور میں خانمیگو کو بالکل اسی طرح دیکھتا ہوں، لیکن میں اسے مکمل طور پر پرکشش بھی دیکھتا ہوں۔ تو میں اسے دیکھ سکتا ہوں، واہ،\nتفریق، اور، بطور معلم، مجھے\n اس تفریق کو فراہم کرنے کے لیے واقعی اتنا کچھ نہیں کرنا پڑا۔ اور یہ سائیڈ پر ایک گائیڈ ہے۔ لیکن اسی ٹوکن پر، یہ ایسی چیز نہیں ہے جو\nبچے نہیں کرنا چاہتے۔ وہ اسے پسند کرتے ہیں۔ اب، ہمارے ایک انگلش ٹیچر، اور میں نے اس پر پوری طرح کریک اپ کیا، کہ ایک بچے نے کہا، اور وہ خانمیگو کے ساتھ\nایک تاریخی شخصیت کے ساتھ بات چیت کر رہا تھا، اور بچے نے کہا، \"یہ TikTok سے زیادہ مزہ ہے۔\" تو سال، آپ نے اسے بنا لیا ہے۔ یہ TikTok سے زیادہ روشن خیال ہے۔ اور جب بچے آپ کو یہ بتاتے ہیں، تو آپ جانتے ہیں کہ آپ کو وہاں کچھ ملا ہے۔ لیکن ویسے بھی، مجھے لگتا ہے کہ اس کے\nساتھ یہ ایک بڑا پلس ہے۔ یہ وہ جگہ نہیں ہے جہاں مجھے صرف\nاپنا کام مکمل کرنا ہے۔ وہ اصل میں وہاں سے باہر ہیں\nاور وہ اس کے ساتھ مشغول ہیں، اور وہ اسے نئی سطحوں پر لے جا رہے ہیں۔ اور ہم نے کچھ ایسے بچوں کے ساتھ پایا جو پائلٹ کا حصہ تھے\n، وہ ایسے کام کر رہے تھے جو ان کے اسائنمنٹ کا حصہ نہیں تھے۔ وہ چیزیں بنانے،\nکمپنیوں کی طرح بنانے، اور ان منظرناموں میں ڈال رہے تھے۔ یہ صرف پراسرار تھا۔ ہم نے ان سے ایسا کرنے کو نہیں کہا۔ انہوں نے صرف یہ پسند کیا. اور اس لیے مجھے لگتا ہے کہ\nہم بچوں کے لیے یہی چاہتے ہیں۔ ہم چاہتے ہیں کہ وہ حیران ہوں۔ ہم چاہتے ہیں کہ وہ اختراع کریں۔ ہم چاہتے ہیں کہ وہ مسئلہ\nحل کرنے والے ہوں اور وہاں جاکر معلومات لیں\nاور اس کے ساتھ کچھ کریں۔ اور واقعی اس کے ساتھ یہی ہوا ہے۔ میرے خیال میں، ایک بار پھر،\n ایک\nمعلم کے طور پر، چیٹ کی تاریخ کو، واپس جانے اور دیکھنے کی خوبصورتی، اس لیے میں جانتا ہوں کہ وہ کیا\nکر رہے ہیں، میں حفاظت دیکھ سکتا ہوں، میں ان کا کام دیکھ سکتا ہوں، وغیرہ، یہ واقعی اہم ہے۔  اساتذہ کو. لیکن مجھے لگتا ہے کہ اس نے منگنی کا\nایک بالکل مختلف مطلب کھول دیا ہے اور وہ کیا سوچ رہے ہیں، اور وہ کس چیز کے بارے میں مزید جاننا چاہتے ہیں، اور وہ اس کے ساتھ کیا کرنا چاہتے ہیں؟ اور مجھے لگتا ہے کہ\nآج ہم جن بچوں کی خدمت کرتے ہیں، میں سمجھتا ہوں کہ ان کا\nدل دوسرے لوگوں کے لیے ہے، اور وہ مسائل حل کرنے والے ہیں۔ مجھے لگتا ہے کہ ان کے\nپاس ایک کاروباری شخصیت ہے، آپ جانتے ہیں، کہ\nوہ چیزیں بنانا چاہتے ہیں اور وہ اس میں کامیاب ہونا چاہتے ہیں، وہ چاہتے ہیں کہ اس سے دوسرے\nلوگوں کی خدمت ہو، مسائل حل ہوں، اور وہ اس کے ساتھ کامیاب ہونا چاہتے ہیں\nبنایا ہے. یہ\nایکویٹی کے ساتھ صرف ایک گیم چینجر ہے۔ اور میں سمجھتا ہوں کہ ڈاکٹر کریگ نے\nبہت اچھا کہا۔ میں انگریزی زبان سیکھنے والے کو لے سکتا ہوں، جسے ہم نے اپنے EL ٹیچر کے ساتھ پائلٹ کیا، اور ان کے لیے صرف ایک گیم چینجر۔ میرا مطلب ہے، ان کی بنیادی زبان ان کے لیے رکاوٹ نہیں ہے۔ وہ اپنے ہم جماعتوں کے برابر ہیں۔ اور یہ بہت زبردست ہے۔ چیزوں میں سے ایک یہ بھی کہ، آپ جانتے ہیں، ہم اپنے اے پی کیمسٹری کے استاد سے بات کر رہے ہیں، جو کہ ایک دوہری کریڈٹ ابتدائی کالج کے استاد ہیں، صرف کچھ مساوات کو دیکھ رہے ہیں جو وہ کیمسٹری میں کر رہے تھے۔ اور، آپ جانتے ہیں، خانمیگو\nانہیں جواب نہیں دے گا، لیکن یہ ان کی تحقیق کر رہا تھا\nکہ جواب کیسے حاصل کیا جائے۔ اور اس طرح ہمارے اساتذہ نے اسے پسند کیا، آپ جانتے ہیں۔ اگر آپ گھر پر\nاس مسئلے کو حل کرنے کی کوشش کر رہے ہیں اور وہ آپ کی مدد نہیں کر سکتے ہیں، تو Khanmigo\nان کی مدد کے لیے موجود تھا۔ اب، میں آپ کو بتاؤں گا\nکہ ان سب نے کہا کہ بعض اوقات بچے AI کو غنڈہ گردی کرنے لگتے ہیں کیونکہ وہ صرف\nجواب چاہتے ہیں اور یہ ایسا نہیں کرے گا۔  تو اساتذہ کو کافی خوشی ہوئی۔ صرف آپ کو بتانے کے لیے،\nآپ کے لیے کچھ تاثرات ہیں۔  خانمیگو کے ساتھ بعض اوقات ایک چھوٹی سی غنڈہ گردی ہوتی رہتی تھی،\n اور یہ، آپ جانتے ہیں، یہ صرف\nانہیں اشارہ کرتا رہا اور کہا، میں آپ کو اس کا جواب نہیں دوں گا۔ - ہاں، ہمیں سکھانا ہے-\n- ہمیں اس کا وہ حصہ پسند آیا۔ - میرے خیال میں سنہری\nاصول AI پر لاگو ہونا چاہیے۔ AI کے ساتھ ایسا سلوک کریں جیسا آپ چاہتے ہیں کہ\nآپ خود سلوک کریں۔ میرا مطلب ہے، صرف\nاس فیڈ بیک لینس کو جاری رکھنا۔ اور میں مذاق نہیں کر رہا تھا جب،\nآپ جانتے ہیں، ہماری آخری میٹنگ، ہمارے پاس خانمیگو پر کئی خصوصیات ہیں جو اس میٹنگ سے براہ راست سامنے آئیں۔ تو میں\nآپ سب کا دماغ چنتا رہوں گا۔ آپ جانتے ہیں، کچھ ایسی چیزیں\nجن پر ہم اوپر اور اس سے آگے کام کر رہے ہیں جن کا\nآپ پہلے ہی تجربہ کر رہے ہیں۔ ہم\nمصنوعی ذہانت دینے، خانمیگو کو یادداشت کا احساس دینے پر کام کر رہے ہیں، تاکہ اسے معلوم ہو کہ استاد یا طالب علم کس لہجے کو ترجیح دیتا ہے۔ یہ پچھلی بات چیت کو یاد رکھتا ہے، یہ وہیں سے شروع ہوسکتا ہے جہاں سے آپ نے چھوڑا تھا۔ ہم ایسی چیزیں شامل کر رہے ہیں\nجہاں اساتذہ Khanmigo کے ذریعے\nخان اکیڈمی کی روایتی سرگرمیاں اور AI سرگرمیاں دونوں تفویض کر سکتے ہیں۔ اور \"\n تاریخی کرداروں سے بات کریں\" کہنے کے بجائے سرگرمی کو ممکنہ طور پر ٹھیک بنائیں۔ جیسے، \"ارے، میں چاہتا ہوں کہ آپ\nبینجمن فرینکلن سے بات کریں اور درج ذیل کا پتہ لگائیں۔\" اور اس طرح ہم اس طرح کی\nچیزیں کرنے والے ہیں۔ ہمارے پاس پہلے سے ہی اس کا تھوڑا سا حصہ ہے، لیکن ہمارے پاس رپورٹنگ کے بارے میں مزید کچھ ہونے والا ہے، جہاں Khanmigo واقعی\nایک تدریسی معاون کے طور پر کام کرتا ہے۔ آپ نے انگریزی زبان سیکھنے والوں کا ذکر کیا۔ ہم نے ابھی جاری کیا ہے کہ یہ اب\nہر بڑی زبان میں کام کرتا ہے۔ اور اس طرح ایک طالب علم اپنی ریاضی یا کیمسٹری انگریزی میں کر رہا ہو سکتا ہے، لیکن وہ\nان کی مدد حاصل کر سکتا ہے یا ہسپانوی یا پرتگالی یا ہندی یا کسی بھی زبان میں اس کی تعلیم حاصل کر سکتا ہے۔ اور پھر دوسری چیز\nجو ہم کرنے کی امید کر رہے ہیں، آئیے اسے اگلے\nچھ مہینوں میں کال کریں، AI ہے، ایسی سرگرمیاں ہوں جو کثیر صارف ہوں، \nبہت سے طلباء کے درمیان باہمی تعاون کے ساتھ سیکھنے میں سہولت فراہم کریں۔ تو، آپ جانتے ہیں، آپ تصور کر سکتے ہیں، AI کے ساتھ\nبحث کرنے کے بجائے ، ہو سکتا ہے کہ AI کئی طلباء کے ساتھ\nبحث کی سہولت فراہم کر سکے۔ یا کئی طلباء کے ساتھ سقراطی مکالمہ چلائیں\n یا متعدد طلباء کے ساتھ ایک سمولیشن یا گیم کریں۔\n تو میں پسند کروں گا کہ آپ سب کے\nخیالات ہیں، آپ جانتے ہیں، اس فہرست میں پہلے سے کیا موجود ہے جس کے بارے میں\nمیں نے ابھی آپ سے بات کی ہے، شاید آپ زیادہ پرجوش ہوں۔ اسے موافقت کرنے کے بارے میں کوئی خیال ہے؟ کوئی تشویش، اور خطرے کی طرف، آپ مزید کیا دیکھنا چاہیں گے؟ کیا وہاں موجود ہیں، کیا آپ کو ایسے\nمسائل نظر آ رہے ہیں جو آپ اس بات کو\nیقینی بنانا چاہتے ہیں کہ ہم معاملات کو ہموار کرنے کے لیے حل کر سکیں؟ میں آپ سے شروع کروں گا، ڈاکٹر بفنگٹن۔ - ٹھیک ہے، میرے خیال میں ان چیزوں میں سے ایک جن\nپر ہم نے رائے دی، ظاہر ہے کہ بعض اوقات ہم ان چیزوں کو اٹھا لیتے ہیں جو ہمارے لیے حفاظتی خدشات ہیں۔ اور مجھے لگتا ہے کہ آپ نے خطاب کیا، آپ جانتے ہیں، فوراً ہی آپ نے اس طرح کی کھودنا شروع کر دی، ہم یہ کیسے یقینی بنا سکتے ہیں کہ اگر کسی طالب علم یا دوسرے لوگوں کے لیے کسی قسم کا خطرہ ہے تو ہمارے لیے، ایک اشارے کا نظام موجود ہے۔ اور اس لیے ہم اس بات کی بہت تعریف کرتے ہیں\nکہ آپ نے وہ رائے لی، کیونکہ اکثر اوقات ہم اسے کلاس میں یا کسی کام یا کام کے باڈی میں لینے کے قابل ہوتے ہیں، یا اگر کوئی طالب علم کسی دوسرے طالب علم یا استاد سے بات کر رہا ہو  , ہم چیزوں کی کچھ نشانیاں لینے کے قابل ہیں جہاں ایک طالب علم کو اضافی مدد کی ضرورت ہو سکتی ہے، کیونکہ وہ\nبہت برے وقت سے گزر رہے ہیں۔ یا\nآپ کو معلوم ہے کہ غلط استعمال یا\nاس اثر کے لیے کچھ امکان موجود ہے۔ اور اس لیے میں سمجھتا ہوں کہ آپ نے\nہمارے تاثرات کو اس لحاظ سے اچھی طرح لیا کہ ہم ان بچوں کے بارے میں فکر مند ہیں جنہیں کچھ اضافی\nسماجی جذباتی مدد کی ضرورت ہو سکتی ہے، یا اگر ان کے\nگھر میں یا دوسرے لوگوں کے ساتھ ان کی حفاظت سے سمجھوتہ کیا جا رہا ہے۔ مجھے لگتا ہے کہ جب ہم نے پہلی بار پائلٹ شروع کیا تو یہ\nہماری سب سے بڑی پریشانیوں میں سے ایک تھی۔ کیونکہ ہمارے پاس\nاس وقت اس طرح کی چیزیں موجود ہیں، اور میں دیکھتا ہوں کہ بچے\nKhanmigo کا زیادہ استعمال کرتے ہیں، میرا مطلب ہے، مجھے لگتا ہے کہ وہ اسے بہت زیادہ استعمال کرنے والے ہیں۔ اور اس لیے اگر وہ اسے بہت زیادہ استعمال کرنے جا رہے ہیں، تو مجھے پسند ہے کہ آپ نے\nکچھ حفاظتی اقدامات کیے ہیں۔ یہ ہمارے لیے واقعی اہم تھا۔ آگے بڑھنے کے لحاظ سے، میرے خیال میں مصروفیت واقعی اہم ہے اور دوسرے لوگوں کے ساتھ بات چیت کرنا۔ زبان کے اس حصے کے لیے آپ کا بہت بہت شکریہ جو آپ نے ابھی بنایا ہے، کیونکہ میرے خیال میں یہ\nابھی بہت اہم ہے۔ اور میں صرف اتنا کہوں گا، ایک چیز جو میرے\nخیال میں واقعی اہم ہے، اور مجھے لگتا ہے کہ یہ پرانے سوال پر واپس چلا جاتا ہے،\n اور ہمیں واقعی یہ سب سے زیادہ\nمڈل اسکول کے بچوں سے ملتا ہے، جیسے،\nمجھے کیوں سیکھنا ہے؟  کہ اور میں سمجھتا ہوں کہ اس\nشعبے میں ماہرین موجود ہیں، اگر ہم کر سکتے ہیں، AI کے اس حصے کے علاوہ، جب آپ یہ کہہ رہے ہوں کہ وہ دوسرے طلباء کے ساتھ بات چیت کر سکتے ہیں، میں ایک ڈیٹا بیس دیکھنا پسند کروں گا\nیا، AI ماہر کے علاوہ، میں\nماہرین کو میدان میں دیکھنا چاہیں گے۔ کیونکہ اکثر اوقات\nکالج اور کیریئر کی تیاری اور ان کے بارے میں سوچتے ہوئے\nہمارے اگلے رہنما ہوں گے، آپ جانتے ہیں، لوگوں سے بات کرتے ہوئے\nاور یہ سمجھتے ہیں کہ وہ زندگی گزارنے کے لیے کیا کرتے ہیں\nاور یہ کیسے بدل سکتا ہے، اور صرف AI کا پورا تصور۔  . میں ایک کیس کا اختتامی نقطہ بتاتا ہوں۔ تو ابھی، جب آپ\nکمپیوٹر سائنس کے بارے میں سوچتے ہیں، اور ہم کوڈنگ کے بارے میں بات کر رہے ہیں اور صرف\nبچوں کو کوڈنگ اور کمپیوٹر سائنس میں جانے کی کوشش کر رہے ہیں،\nاب یہ مختلف ہونے جا رہا ہے۔ AI اسے بالکل مختلف ذائقہ دیتا ہے، اور میں سمجھتا ہوں کہ انہیں AI ماہر کے علاوہ ان\nسے بات کرنے کی ضرورت ہے، وہ کون لوگ ہیں جو میدان میں ہیں؟ اپنے لوگوں کی طرح۔ جیسے یہ پردے کے پیچھے کیسے کام کرتا ہے؟ اور کیا، اور آپ\nیہ زندگی گزارنے کے لیے کرنا چاہتے ہیں؟ اور اگر آپ واقعی اس سے لطف اندوز ہوتے ہیں، تو\nیہ واقعی کوئی کام نہیں ہے۔ لیکن میں سمجھتا ہوں کہ اس\nسے زیادہ ہونے کی ضرورت ہے۔ اور اس طرح، آپ جانتے ہیں، وہاں\nسافٹ ویئر موجود ہے جس سے آپ\nیہاں کسی ماہر، وہاں کے ماہر سے مل سکتے ہیں۔ لیکن بچوں کو اس کا حقیقی ذائقہ دینا۔ اور پھر، میرا مطلب ہے، آپ اب بھی کر سکتے ہیں، اگر آپ انہیں\nدوسرے بچوں سے ملنے کی اجازت دیتے ہیں، تو میں انہیں میدان میں\nدوسرے ماہرین سے ملتے دیکھنا چاہوں گا۔ - یہ ایک دلچسپ خیال ہے۔ مجھے لگتا ہے کہ آپ سب جانتے ہیں کہ ہمارے پاس\nایک اور غیر منفعتی بہن ہے جو میں نے\nاسکول ہاؤس ڈاٹ ورلڈ نامی وبائی بیماری کے دوران شروع کی تھی، جو، اور اسکول ہاؤس کی پوری بنیاد ہے،\n آپ جانتے ہیں، یہ\nدنیا کو سیکھنے کے ذریعے جوڑتا ہے اور لوگوں کو مفت لائیو\nٹیوشن دیتا ہے۔  ویڈیو کانفرنس۔ اور ہم ایسا کرنے کا طریقہ\nرضاکاروں کا فائدہ اٹھانا ہے۔ رضاکاروں میں سے بہت سے ہائی\nاسکول یا کالج کے طالب علم ہیں، لیکن ان میں سے بہت سے پیشہ ور ہیں۔ اور جب ہم نے\nKhanmigo کو لانچ کیا تو ہم نے سوچنا شروع کیا، ٹھیک ہے کہ شاید Khanmigo\n روایتی خان اکیڈمی اور شاید\nschoolhouse.world کے درمیان ایک دلچسپ پُل ثابت ہو سکتا ہے، جہاں آپ کے\nحقیقی لوگ نظر آتے ہیں۔ اور اسی طرح، پیگی، آپ کا خیال،\nمیں تقریباً اس طرح کے بارے میں سوچ رہا ہوں، اگر اسکول ہاؤس ڈاٹ ورلڈ،\nمیرے خیال میں زیادہ تر پیشہ ور افراد کسی نہ کسی طرح واپس دینا پسند کریں گے۔ وہ یہ بتانا پسند کریں گے،\nآپ جانتے ہیں، زیادہ تر والدین، جب وہ گھر جاتے ہیں، تو وہ اپنے بچوں کو اپنی ملازمت کے بارے میں بتانا چاہتے ہیں اور ان کے بچوں کو کوئی دلچسپی نہیں ہے۔ لیکن بچوں کو\nوالدین کی دوسری ملازمتوں کے بارے میں دلچسپی ہو سکتی ہے، جو کہ ایسا ہوتا ہے۔ اور اس لیے ایک تفریحی طریقہ ہو سکتا ہے جہاں آپ ان پر دکھا سکتے ہیں،\nاسکول ہاؤس کا کہنا ہے، اور پھر خانمیگو کہہ سکتے ہیں، ارے، آپ سوچ رہے تھے کہ یہ کیوں اہمیت رکھتا ہے۔ ایک سیشن ہو رہا ہے۔ فلاں فلاں دکھا رہا ہے کہ\nکون اے آئی محقق ہے، یا ڈاکٹر کون ہے، یا\nوکیل کون ہے، جو اس کے بارے میں بات کر سکتا ہے، آپ اس پر کیوں نہیں جاتے، اور\nآپ اس بارے میں بہت کچھ سیکھیں گے کہ یہ الجبرا کیوں ہے  مفید تو مجھے وہ خیال پسند ہے۔ ڈاکٹر کریگ، مزید خیالات،\nان کو آتے رہیں، ہم نہیں کر سکتے- - ہاں، نہیں، میں-\n- اور خوف، اور خطرات، 'کیونکہ یہ بھی ایسے\nخیالات ہیں جو، آپ جانتے ہیں، ہمارے لیے اسے بہتر بنانے کے مواقع۔ - لہذا، بالکل واضح طور پر،\nاس نوٹ کو ختم کرنے کے لئے، مجھے ایک طالب علم کے طور پر یاد ہے، میں سمجھ نہیں پایا کہ\nشیکسپیئر کیوں، مثال کے طور پر. اور، آپ جانتے ہیں، کالج میں،\nجب میں انڈرگریڈ تھا اور پھر گریڈ اسکول اور کیا نہیں، میں نے\nاس کے لیے ایک مختلف تعریف کرنا شروع کردی۔ لیکن ستم ظریفی کی بات یہ ہے کہ ڈاکٹر بفنگٹن کی بات یہ ہے کہ اصل میں جو چیز شروع ہوئی وہ یہ تھی کہ\nیہ چھوٹی سی ویڈیو تھی جس پر میں نے ٹھوکر کھائی، جہاں ایسے اداکار اور اداکارائیں موجود تھیں جو شیکسپیئر کے بارے میں بات کر رہے تھے۔ اور پہلی بار میں نے\nتھیٹر کو دیکھنا شروع کیا، مثال کے طور پر، نہ صرف\nاس کی اپنی خاموش حقیقت میں، جیسے، اوہ، یہ تھیٹر ہے،\nبلکہ ایک پل کے طور پر، اگر آپ چاہیں گے، جیسا کہ آپ نے ذکر کیا ہے، ہر\nطرح کے دوسرے پیشوں کو۔  . اور جب آپ یہ دیکھتے اور سنتے ہیں کہ چیزیں اب کس طرح ہائبرڈ ہیں، ٹھیک ہے، چیزیں اب خاموش نہیں ہیں،\nآپ کسی موضوع میں رہ سکتے ہیں اور تصورات،\nاصولوں، تجربات کو نہ صرف دوسری چیزوں پر لاگو کر سکتے ہیں\nجو آپ کر رہے ہیں۔  فی الحال، لیکن امکانات لامتناہی ہیں کیونکہ ہم واقعی نہیں جانتے کہ یہ\nبعد میں کیسے آئے گا، ٹھیک ہے؟ ہم ہمیشہ\nشعوری طور پر اس سے آگاہ نہیں ہوتے ہیں۔ اور اس لیے جب میں\n خانمیگو کے ذریعے طلباء کے لیے موجودہ سرگرمیوں کے بارے میں سوچتا ہوں، تو میں آپ کی حوصلہ افزائی کروں گا کہ وہ\n سائلو کو توڑنے کے طریقے تلاش کرتے رہیں۔ اور اس سے میرا مطلب ہے، آپ جانتے ہیں،\nیہ لکھنے کے طریقوں کی طرح ہے۔  بہت لمبے عرصے تک لکھنے کے طریقوں کو اس\nطرح سکھایا جاتا تھا جو واحد تھا۔ تو یہ اس طرح ہے، یہ وضاحتی تحریر ہے، یہ دلیلی تحریر ہے،\nیہ بیانیہ تحریر ہے۔ لیکن، آپ جانتے ہیں، تحقیق سے پتہ چلتا ہے\nکہ ہمارے سب سے کامیاب مصنفین کا تحریری عمل، یہ \nروایتی K-12 تعلیمی نظام سے گزرنے سے پہلے چھوٹے بچوں کی عکاسی کرتا ہے، کیونکہ بالکل وہی جو\nہم نے پہلے بات کی تھی۔ تجسس  کیا یہ نظم و ضبط ہے؟ ضرور اسٹیفن کنگ کو لکھتے ہوئے پڑھیں، وہ آپ کو بتائے گا کہ یہ ایک\nڈسپلن ہے، یہ ایک سائنس ہے، لیکن یہ جذبہ ہونا چاہیے۔ اور اس لیے میرے لیے، میں سوچتا ہوں کہ\n ہم نے کیا کیا ہے، ہم کیا کر رہے ہیں، اور ہم کیا کر سکتے تھے اور کیا کرنا چاہیے۔ ہمیں کیا کرنے کی ضرورت ہے،\nہم کر سکتے ہیں اور کرنا چاہیے، کلاسوں کے درمیان دیواروں کو توڑنا، \nاسکول میں اور اسکول سے باہر دیواروں کو توڑنا ہے۔ ڈاکٹر بفنگٹن آپ کو بتا سکتے ہیں کہ اس وقت جو ہماری سب سے کامیاب\nچیزیں چل رہی ہیں وہ آرگینک ہیں، اور وہ\nپھر منظم ہو جاتی ہیں، جہاں انجینئرنگ\nٹیچر بزنس ٹیچر کے ساتھ شراکت کرتا ہے، جو\nPLTW بائیو میڈ میں استاد کے ساتھ شراکت کرتا ہے۔ کیوں، کیونکہ وہ جذبات سے جڑے ہوئے ہیں۔ وہ ان چیزوں کے ساتھ منسلک ہیں جن\nمیں آپ کی دلچسپی ہے۔ لہذا اگر میں کسی ایسی چیز کو دیکھتا ہوں\nجیسے کہ ایک کہانی تیار کرنا، جب آپ باہر جاتے ہیں اور آپ پڑھتے ہیں اور آپ پوڈ کاسٹ سنتے ہیں تو سمجھنا، بحث کا حصہ کہانی\nسنانا ہے، ٹھیک ہے؟  ایسی کوئی چیز نہیں ہے، اوہ،\nیہ وضاحتی تحریر ہے، تو میں صرف معلومات کو ظاہر کرتا ہوں، ٹھیک ہے؟ لکھنا گڑبڑ ہے۔ لکھنے کا عمل غیر خطی ہے۔ سب کچھ بدلتا اور بدلتا ہے۔ تو ڈاکٹر بفنگٹن کی\nطرف، یہاں دو چیزیں۔ ایک، ان عنوانات کو اس طرح سے لاگو کرنا جو اسے زیادہ سے زیادہ ہموار بناتا ہے، اور اسی وجہ سے مجھے آپ کا تبصرہ پسند ہے، سال، اس سفر کے بارے میں جو کہ خود ہی تعمیر کر رہا ہے۔ اور اگر AI کی صلاحیت ایسی ہے جہاں یہ سیکھنے کی ترقی کو جاری رکھنے کی اجازت دیتی ہے، تو\n یہ گیم چینجر ہے۔  گریڈ اسکول میں میری ایک بہترین کمپوزیشن\nٹیچر تھی، اس نے اس کے بارے میں بات کی، آپ جانتے ہیں، لکھنے کا بالآخر\nاندازہ کیسے لگایا جانا چاہیے، ان چھوٹی باتوں پر نہیں، آپ جانتے ہیں جیسے، اوہ، آپ نے\nیہ کلاس لی اور A یا وہ کلاس حاصل کی اور  B حاصل کی ہے۔ یہ ہونا چاہئے،\nطلباء کی شروعات کہاں سے ہوئی، اور پھر وہ طبقہ کے قدرتی سرے پر کہاں ختم ہوئے۔ اور یہ اس ترقی کے بارے میں ہے۔ ٹھیک ہے، وہ ترقی ایسی ہے\nجہاں سے آپ سمجھنا شروع کرتے ہیں، اوہ، سب کچھ بیان بازی ہے، ٹھیک ہے؟ آپ افلاطون کے پاس واپس جائیں، آپ\nجانتے ہیں، سقراط، ارسطو کے پاس، جو بھی معاملہ ہے،\nسب کچھ بیان بازی ہے۔ ٹھیک ہے، ہمارے طلباء اب\nایک ایسی دنیا کے سامنے پیش کر رہے ہیں جو بہت بڑی ہے، لیکن یہ\nطاق بھی ہو سکتی ہے، ٹھیک ہے؟ ہم ان چیزوں کو کیسے لے سکتے ہیں جو وہ تاریخ کے بارے میں سیکھ رہے ہیں،\nٹیکنالوجی کے بارے میں، انجینئرنگ کے بارے میں،\nآپ جانتے ہیں، انسانی جسم کے بارے میں، ان تمام مختلف چیزوں کو اور کہتے ہیں، یہ ان شعبوں پر لاگو ہو سکتا ہے\nجن کا وجود ہی نہیں ہے۔ اس کا اطلاق ختم ہوسکتا ہے،\nیہ چپچپا ہوسکتا ہے، ٹھیک ہے؟  اس طرح ہمارا دماغ کام کرتا ہے۔ ہمیں ان چیزوں پر معلومات قائم کرنے کی ضرورت ہے جن پر ہمارے پاس پہلے سے ہی فریم ورک بنا ہوا ہے، اس طرح کہ اب میں کلاس میں جو کچھ کر رہا ہوں اس کو\nمیرے پاس موجود سائیڈ ہسٹل کے ساتھ جوڑ رہا ہوں، آپ جانتے ہیں، ایک دکان جو میں\nسائیڈ پر کرتا ہوں۔  یا جو کچھ بھی ہو، اور گھر میں بھی میری اپنی\nذاتی اور، آپ جانتے ہیں، ترجیحات اور جو بھی معاملہ ہو۔ لہذا، مثال کے طور پر، اگر میں\n کھیلوں سے متعلق چیزوں کے بارے میں پوڈ کاسٹ سنتا ہوں، تو اس سے\n میرے ریکارڈ شدہ ہونے کا طریقہ بدل سکتا ہے، آپ\nجانتے ہیں، عملے کے لیے سیشن، کیونکہ مجھے یہ پسند ہے\nکہ وہ اس کو متعارف کرائیں یا وہ  آپ جانتے ہیں، وہاں آواز کا انفلیکشن استعمال کریں اور کیا نہیں۔ تو میری حوصلہ افزائی دوگنا ہو گی۔ ایک، یہ\nبتانے کے لیے ان سائلو کو توڑنا جاری رکھیں کہ یہ ساری چیزیں\nدوسری چیزوں میں کیسے فٹ بیٹھتی ہیں، ٹھیک ہے؟ اور پھر دو،\nخانمیگو میں ابھی تھوڑا سا ہے، جیسا کہ اس کا تعلق\nکالج میں داخلے اور مالی امداد کو نیویگیٹ کرنے سے ہے، آپ جانتے ہیں، اور پھر کیریئر کے پہلو کو بھی پسند کرتے ہیں۔ تو میں کہوں گا، میں\nآپ کی حوصلہ افزائی کروں گا کہ طلباء کو جوڑنا جاری رکھیں اور\nوہ جس کے بارے میں سیکھ رہے ہیں یا سیکھ سکتے ہیں، پھر کس چیز کے ساتھ۔ اور جب آپ ریاست انڈیانا کی طرح کے بارے میں سوچتے ہیں،\n مثال کے طور پر، ڈاکٹر\nبفنگٹن اور میں اور ہماری ٹیم یہاں جو کچھ کر رہی ہے اس میں سے بہت کچھ\nطلباء کو کرنسی کی اسٹیک ایبل اسناد کے ساتھ ترتیب دینے میں مدد کر رہا ہے، مستقبل کے آجروں،\nاسکالرشپ کمیٹیوں،  وغیرہ، کہ میں کسی چیز پر مہارت رکھتا ہوں\nیا کسی چیز میں مہارت رکھتا ہوں یا کسی چیز میں تجربہ رکھتا ہوں۔ ہم اسے ڈیجیٹل بیجز اور اس نوعیت کی چیزوں کے ساتھ بھی دیکھتے ہیں۔ لہذا جب ایک طالب علم کیریئر کا راستہ دیکھتا ہے، تو یہ خوفزدہ ہوتا ہے کیونکہ\nجو زبان اس کی خصوصیت کے لیے استعمال کی جاتی ہے اس کا\n اس پیشے کی اصل چیز سے کوئی تعلق نہیں ہو سکتا۔ اور یا مستقبل کے پیشے جن\nکے لیے میں ان چیزوں کو استعمال کر سکتا ہوں وہ بھی موجود نہیں ہے، ٹھیک ہے؟ اور اس طرح ہم\nان دنیاوں سے شادی کرنے کی کوشش کیسے کر سکتے ہیں تاکہ طالب علموں کو\n مختصر مدت میں ان کے مستقبل سے منسلک کیا جا سکے، ساتھ ہی، آپ جانتے ہیں، وہاں موجود مواقع\nجو اس کے بعد موجود ہیں جن کے بارے میں ہم ابھی تک نہیں جانتے ہیں۔ - مجھے پسند ہے کہ، مضامین کے درمیان رکاوٹوں کو توڑنے کا اس قسم کا تھیم، جو میرے خیال میں اب پہلے\nسے کہیں زیادہ قابل عمل ہے۔ اور پھر\nاسکول اور حقیقی دنیا کے درمیان بھی۔ آپ کے لیے ایک آخری سوال ڈاکٹر بفنگٹن۔ آئیے تیزی سے آگے بڑھیں، مجھے نہیں\nمعلوم، دو، تین سال۔ یہ زیادہ وقت نہیں ہے، لیکن چیزیں بہت تیزی سے بدل رہی ہیں. کیا آپ کو لگتا ہے کہ\nہم نے جس چیز کے بارے میں بات کی ہے وہ کسی نہ کسی طرح بنیادی طور پر\nاسکول کی طرح کو تبدیل کرنے والی ہے، بشمول، آپ جانتے ہیں، ہم نے تشخیص جیسی چیزوں کے بارے میں بھی بات نہیں کی،\n جن کے بارے میں ہم\nاپنی طرف سے سوچنا شروع کر رہے ہیں۔ یا کیا آپ کو لگتا ہے کہ یہ موجودہ فن تعمیر کے سب سے\nاوپر ایک اچھا ضمیمہ ہوگا ؟ یا کیا آپ کو لگتا ہے کہ کچھ طریقوں سے یہ کلاس روم کو\nبنیادی طور پر تبدیل کرتا ہے، ڈاکٹر بفنگٹن؟ - ٹھیک ہے، میرا مطلب ہے، ٹم کو\nیہ معلوم ہو گا، ڈاکٹر کریگ۔ میرا مطلب ہے، میرے پاس یہ فلسفہ تھا\nکہ، آپ جانتے ہیں، COVID کے دوران، کہ زمین کی تزئین\nہمیشہ کے لیے بدل گئی تھی، ٹھیک ہے؟ میرا مطلب ہے، یہ پہلے ہی بدل چکا ہے۔ اگر میں\nاپنے عوامی ادارے میں آکر سارا دن بیٹھنا نہیں چاہتا ہوں، تو میں\nآن لائن اسکول جانے کا انتخاب کرسکتا ہوں اور، آپ جانتے ہیں، شاید یہ میرے لیے کارآمد ہو۔ مجھے لگتا ہے کہ، میں سوچتا ہوں کہ جب میں اسے دیکھتا ہوں، تو میں اسے اضافی کے طور پر نہیں دیکھنا چاہتا۔ میں اسے ایک ٹول کے طور پر دیکھنا چاہتا ہوں\nجو کہ ایک ٹول ہے جو کہ آپ جانتے ہیں کہ یہ اب قابل استعمال ہے، لیکن یہ\nمستقبل میں ہماری مدد کرنے کے قابل بھی ہے۔ آپ جانتے ہیں، جب میں چیزوں کے بارے میں سوچتا ہوں اور کالج\nکیرئیر کی تیاری کے بارے میں سوچتا ہوں، اور، آپ جانتے ہیں، ابھی میں ایک بچے کو\nجلد باہر نکلنے، جلد فارغ التحصیل ہونے کی اجازت دے سکتا ہوں، اور، آپ جانتے ہیں، میرے\nبچے ہیں جو ایسوسی ایٹس کی ڈگریوں کے ساتھ گریجویشن کر رہے ہیں۔\nہمارا ہائی اسکول ابھی۔ میں یہاں ممکنہ طور پر کیا ہوتا دیکھ رہا ہوں؟ میں دیکھ رہا ہوں کہ لوگ ان بچوں کے ساتھ کیا چاہتے ہیں جو اب ہائی اسکول سے فارغ التحصیل ہیں۔ وہ چاہتے ہیں کہ وہ مسئلہ حل کرنے والے ہوں۔ وہ چاہتے ہیں کہ وہ\nایک ٹیم میں تعاون کرنے اور کام کرنے کے قابل ہوں۔ وہ چاہتے ہیں کہ\nان کے پیچھے اخلاقی مشقیں ہوں۔ اور مجھے لگتا ہے کہ آپ کے پاس پہلے سے ہی\nاس کی صلاحیت ہے۔ اب دلچسپ بات یہ ہے کہ میں ایک طالب علم کو انٹرن شپ کیسے دوں، اور ہوسکتا ہے کہ خانمیگو میں\nاس کا کوئی انٹرنشپ پہلو ہو اور یہ ان کے دن کے لیے شمار ہو۔ آپ جانتے ہیں، میں\nہائی اسکول کو دوبارہ ایجاد کرنے کے بارے میں ہوں اور یہ کیسا لگتا ہے۔ اور، آپ جانتے ہیں، میں سمجھتا ہوں کہ\nیہ آپ کو معلوم ہے، مڈل اسکول، ایلیمنٹری تک جاتا ہے۔ میرے خیال میں\nاس AI کے بہت سے مختلف پہلو ہیں جنہیں میں دریافت کر سکتا ہوں۔ آپ جانتے ہیں، جب میں اس\nکے بارے میں سوچتا ہوں، بچے مزہ کرنا چاہتے ہیں، وہ اسائنمنٹس سے نہیں ڈرنا چاہتے، میں پہلے ہی دیکھتا ہوں کہ وہ حصہ ٹھیک ہو گیا ہے۔ میں دیکھتا ہوں کہ بچے وہاں\nصرف اس لیے جاتے ہیں کیونکہ وہ چاہتے ہیں، اور وہ سوال پوچھنا پسند کرتے ہیں۔ اور ہم بطور معلم یہی چاہتے ہیں۔ ہم چاہتے ہیں کہ وہ سوال کریں۔ اور وہ اس کی طرف متوجہ ہیں. اور اس لیے میں اس سحر کو لینا چاہتا ہوں\nاور اس پر استوار کرنا چاہتا ہوں۔ اور اگر اس کا مطلب یہ ہے کہ\nہم اسکول کے طریقے کو دوبارہ ڈیزائن کریں، تو ہمیں یہ کرنا ہوگا، ٹھیک ہے؟ اور اس لیے ہمارے پاس پہلے سے ہی ابتدائی کالج کے ساتھ اپنے ہائی اسکولوں کو کچھ نئے سرے سے ڈیزائن اور نئے سرے سے تیار کرنا ہے\nاور، آپ جانتے ہیں، آپ\n کالج کے ایک سال، کالج کے دو سال کے لیے انڈسٹری سرٹیفیکیشن حاصل کر سکتے ہیں۔ ضروری نہیں کہ آپ کو\nہفتے میں پانچ دن جانا پڑے۔ آپ کو شاید پورا دن جانے کی ضرورت نہیں ہے۔ کیونکہ آپ کو ایک مختلف موقع مل سکتا ہے۔\n اور اگر یہ موقع\nخود کو اس طرح پیش کرتا ہے، تو آپ کو گریجویٹ ہونے اور شاید افرادی قوت میں داخل ہونے یا پوسٹ سیکنڈری میں داخل ہونے کے لیے تصدیق کی جاتی ہے تاکہ ہم کیا\nحاصل کرنے کی کوشش کر رہے ہیں، آپ جانتے ہیں، کچھ پوسٹ سیکنڈری اسناد جو تعاون کرتی ہیں  دنیا کے لیے۔ اور اس لیے میں سب کے بارے میں ہوں، کیا ان چیزوں کو نئے سرے سے ایجاد کرنے کے\nبہتر طریقے، زیادہ موثر طریقے یا زیادہ\nپرجوش، پرکشش طریقے ہیں جو ہم کر رہے ہیں؟ اور مجھے لگتا ہے کہ، مجھے لگتا ہے کہ کسی بھی چیز کی طرح جو\nتعلیم کے لیے نئی ہو، بعض اوقات ہم آخری اختیار کرنے والے ہوتے ہیں۔ اور تو کیوں؟ اور مجھے لگتا ہے کہ ہم نے اس کے بارے میں بات کرنا شروع کردی ہے۔ وہ اس سے ڈرتے ہیں۔ اور آپ اس سے ڈر نہیں سکتے، آپ کو گلے لگانا ہوگا کہ مستقبل کیا ہے۔ اور اس لیے مجھے لگتا ہے کہ\n جب آپ ضمنی کے بارے میں بات کر رہے ہیں تو کچھ موافقت ہو گی،\nٹھیک ہے؟ میرا مطلب ہے، جیسے، تو ابھی\nآپ کے پاس ابتدائی طور پر اپنانے والے ہوں گے جو بنیادی طور پر وہ کچھ لیں گے جو ان کے\nنصاب کے نقشے میں ہے اور کہیں گے، \"AI میری مدد کیسے کرتا ہے؟\" \"میں خانمیگو کا استعمال کیسے کر سکتا ہوں؟\" اور پھر آپ\nکچھ ٹریل بلیزنگ دیکھنا شروع کریں گے جہاں یہ ایسا ہوگا، واہ، میں\nنہیں ہوں، یہ کوئی متبادل نہیں ہے۔ اور آپ دیکھیں گے کہ\nوہ اسے اس طریقے سے استعمال کرنا شروع کرتے ہیں جس سے اور بھی اضافہ ہوتا ہے، اور یہ اس کی جگہ نہیں لے رہا ہے جیسا کہ انہوں نے کیا تھا۔ اور یہ بچوں کو\nبڑھنے اور سیکھنے پر مجبور کر رہا ہے اور شاید اس خیال کے ساتھ آئے\nکہ وہ کچھ ٹھیک کر سکتے ہیں۔ آپ جانتے ہیں، مجھے یہ حقیقت پسند ہے\nکہ یہ ایک ایسی نسل ہے جو مسائل کو حل کرنا پسند کرتی ہے۔ اور وہ اس طرح کہیں گے، \"اس کا کیا؟\" یا، \"اس کے بارے میں کیا؟\" اور مجھے لگتا ہے کہ اس میں\nایسا کرنے کی صلاحیت ہے۔ لہذا اگر میرے پاس کوئی طالب علم ہے اور، آپ جانتے ہیں کہ، ہم جس کے بارے میں بات کر رہے تھے، اس کے بارے میں بات کرنے کے لیے، ہم بچوں کو بائیو میڈیکل کلاس میں ڈالیں گے اور پھر ہم انہیں انجینئرنگ پروگرام کے ساتھ بٹ اپ کریں گے، کیونکہ وہ ایک چیز کے بارے میں سوچ رہے ہیں اور  یہ وہ لوگ ہیں جو واقعی آپ کے لیے اسے بنا سکتے ہیں یا آپ کے\nحساب کتاب یا کسی بھی چیز میں آپ کی مدد کر سکتے ہیں۔ وہ رکاوٹیں ٹوٹ چکی ہیں۔ اور میں دیکھ رہا ہوں کہ ہائی اسکول کو\nمکمل طور پر نئے سرے سے ایجاد کیا جا رہا ہے اور بچوں کو\nاسے حقیقی دنیا کی ترتیب میں لاگو کرنے کا موقع فراہم کیا جا رہا ہے۔ اور اس لیے میں سمجھتا ہوں کہ اس کی گنجائش ہے، اور میں\nیہاں آپ کو ایک تصور دینے والا ہوں، آپ جانتے ہیں، انڈیانا کیریئر اسکالرشپ اکاؤنٹس کے ساتھ کچھ کر رہی ہے۔\n انہیں CSAs کہا جاتا ہے۔ اور اس کا اصل مقصد\nبچوں کو افرادی قوت، اور کام پر مبنی سیکھنے اور انٹرنشپ میں شامل کرنا ہے۔ اور وہ پہلے ہی اس بات پر ہیں کہ ایک ہائی اسکول ڈپلومہ اس بچے کے ساتھ کیسا ہوگا جسے ہم یہ CSA دیتے ہیں؟ اور کیا یہ واقعی روایتی ہے، جیسے آپ کے پاس\nاس اور اس اور اس کے 40 کریڈٹ ہونے چاہئیں۔ اور وہ دیکھنا شروع کر رہے ہیں، ٹھیک ہے، آہ، شاید انہیں اس کی ضرورت نہیں ہے۔ اور ہو سکتا ہے، شاید\nوہ کوئی ایسا شخص ہو گا جسے میں نے افرادی قوت میں رکھا ہو جس کے پاس\nٹیکنالوجی کو مناسب طریقے سے استعمال کرنے کے بارے میں کچھ جانکاری ہو، اور وہ کسی ایسی چیز کا حل نکالیں جس کو تلاش کرنے کے لیے وہ جدوجہد کر رہے ہوں۔ میرے خیال میں اس کے لیے صلاحیت موجود ہے۔ مجھے لگتا ہے کہ آپ\nابتدائی اپنانے والوں کو اضافی، تبدیل کرنے، اور پھر نئی چیزیں ڈھونڈتے ہوئے دیکھیں گے۔ اور پھر مجھے لگتا ہے کہ آپ\nبچوں کو ایسے ہوتے دیکھیں گے، میں یہ کر سکتا ہوں، میں یہ کر سکتا ہوں۔ اور ہمیں ترقی کی اجازت دینے کے لیے جس\nطرح سے ہم ڈیلیور کر رہے ہیں اس کو دوبارہ دیکھنا ہو گا، اگر یہ سمجھ میں آتا ہے۔ - ایک ٹن احساس بناتا ہے۔ اور، آپ جانتے ہیں، میں\nآپ دونوں سے گھنٹوں بات کر سکتا ہوں، خاص طور پر اس موضوع کے بارے میں، کیونکہ\nیہ بہت دلکش ہے۔ لیکن مجھے اس قسم کا\nآخری دھکا بہت پسند ہے جہاں، آپ جانتے ہیں، تمام حدود کو توڑ دیتے ہیں اور درحقیقت ہم ہمیشہ اپنے خیالات، سرگرمی کے خیالات آپ سے حاصل کرتے ہیں، ڈاکٹر بفنگٹن۔ اور آپ نے ایک ایسی چیز کو تقویت بخشی جس کے بارے میں ہم ذہن سازی کر رہے تھے، یعنی، اگر\nطالب علموں کے لیے، یا اساتذہ کے لیے یا کسی کے لیے بھی، دنیا کے بڑے مسائل کو حل کرنے کے لیے کوئی سرگرمی ہو۔ آپ جانتے ہیں، آپ کو ہماری ضرورت ہے، آپ کو\nآب و ہوا سے نمٹنے کی ضرورت ہے، آپ یہ جاننا چاہتے ہیں کہ\nمیں، ایک طالب علم کے طور پر، موسمیاتی تبدیلی سے کیسے نمٹنا شروع کر سکتا ہوں؟ میں، بطور طالب علم،\nکینسر کی تحقیق سے کیسے نمٹنا شروع کر سکتا ہوں؟ میں، ایک طالب علم کے طور پر، کیسے\nنمٹنا شروع کر سکتا ہوں، مجھے نہیں معلوم، دنیا میں جو بھی مسئلہ\nآپ کے خیال میں حل کرنے کی ضرورت ہے۔ بہت سارے طلباء چاہتے ہیں، لیکن وہ نہیں جانتے کہ کہاں سے\nشروع کریں، کہاں سے کریں، اس لیے مجھے یہ خیال بھی پسند ہے۔ ٹھیک ہے، آپ دونوں کا شکریہ- - اور سال کر سکتے ہیں، سال میں\nصرف اس لحاظ سے ذکر کر سکتا ہوں کہ آپ نے ابھی کیا کہا اور یہ\nکتنا اہم ہے، اور وہ ان چیزوں کو حل کرنے کی کوشش کرتے ہیں\nجو ان کے لیے بہت اہم ہیں۔ لہذا COVID کے دوران، میرا ایک\nطالب علم یہ جاننے کی کوشش کر رہا تھا کہ ایمرجنسی روم میں \nعلامات کے ساتھ چیک ان کا بہتر نظام کیسے رکھا جائے۔ - ہمم.\n- اور کیوں۔ وہ چاہتی تھی کہ وہ انہیں مطلع کرے کہ آپ کو دوبارہ ترجیح دینا ہوگی کہ\nآپ کے ایمرجنسی روم میں کون ہے، کیونکہ اس کے دادا کی موت COVID سے ہوئی ہے۔ تو میرے پاس یہ چھوٹا سا\nکاروباری اختراع کار تھا، اور ہمارے پاس یہاں بنانے والے کی جگہیں ہیں،\nہم کرتے ہیں، آپ جانتے ہیں، ہم سازوں کے میلے کرتے ہیں، ہمارے پاس ہے، اور ہمارے پاس ہر جگہ STEM کی جگہیں ہیں۔ اور اس کی تخلیق تھی، اور اس نے\nہسپتال میں انجینئرز کے ساتھ علامات اور وہ کہاں پر کام کیا، اور ہم کس طرح ترجیح دیتے ہیں کہ\nآپ پہلے کس کو دیکھیں گے، کیونکہ یہ اس کے اور آپ کے لیے بہت حقیقی تھا۔ آپ جانتے ہیں، جب آپ\nموسمیاتی تبدیلی کے بارے میں کہہ رہے ہیں، وہ چیزیں جو ان کے لیے واقعی اہمیت رکھتی ہیں، وہ سارا دن گزاریں گے۔ یہ اس قسم کا طالب علم ہے\nجو بستر پر نہیں جائے گا کیونکہ وہ یہ\nجاننے کی کوشش کر رہے ہیں کہ معلومات کہاں ہے،\nکس قسم کا آلہ ہے، کس قسم کا آلہ ہے۔ وہ بایومیڈ کلاس میں ہے، انجینئرنگ کلاس میں جاتی ہے اور وہ ایک ہینڈ ہیلڈ بنا رہے ہیں، اور یہ\nگھڑیوں کے ساتھ یا ہسپتال میں جو بھی ہے، مطابقت پذیر ہو جائے گا، \nپسند کی ترجیح کو تبدیل کرنے کے لیے، اب آپ کو کس کو دیکھنے کی ضرورت ہے؟ اور میں صرف سوچتا ہوں کہ ہمارے بچوں میں\nیہ صلاحیت ہے، ٹھیک ہے؟ اور اس طرح، اندازہ لگائیں، جو\nاس کے کلاس روم میں نہیں ہوا، جو اس کے کلاس روم سے باہر ہوا، لیکن وہ اسے کلاس روم میں لے آئی کہ ایک بہتر طریقہ ہونا چاہیے۔ ٹھیک ہے؟ اور اس لیے میں سمجھتا ہوں کہ اس سے\nہر قسم کے سوالات یا مسائل کی راہیں کھل جاتی ہیں\nجنہیں وہ حل کرنا چاہتے ہیں، اور اس سے انہیں ایک اچھی شروعات ملتی ہے اور اس سے وہ\nاس کے پیچھے چلتے رہنا چاہیں گے۔ تم جانتے ہو میرا کیا مطلب ہے؟ اور مجھے لگتا ہے کہ یہ اس کی خوبصورتی ہے۔ یہ بہت دلچسپ ہے، وہ رکنا نہیں چاہتے - 100%۔ مزید اتفاق نہیں ہو سکا۔\n- سال، اگر میں کر سکتا ہوں. بس ہماری دونوں طرف سے،\nآپ جانتے ہیں، آپ کا شکریہ، آپ جانتے ہیں، آپ نے یہی کیا، ٹھیک ہے؟ آپ نے\nایک مسئلہ، ایک ضرورت کی نشاندہی کرکے شروعات کی، ٹھیک ہے، جو\nخاندانی لحاظ سے آپ کے لیے ذاتی تھا۔ اور آپ نے بہت سارے\nسوالات پوچھے اور آپ ٹریل بلیز، اور پھر، آپ جانتے ہیں، ہم یہاں ہیں، ٹھیک ہے؟ اور اس لیے ہماری امید یہ ہے کہ ہم تینوں جتنے پرجوش ہیں،\nمثال کے طور پر، تعلیم کے بارے میں اور، آپ جانتے ہیں، خانمیگو، اور\nاپنے طالب علموں کی مدد کرنے کے مختلف طریقے، آپ جانتے ہیں، مشن پر رہیں، قابل ہونے کے لیے۔  اپنے شوق کو آگے بڑھانے کے لیے۔ اگر وہ ان چیزوں کے بارے میں اسی طرح کا جذبہ رکھ سکتے ہیں جس میں وہ دلچسپی رکھتے ہیں، اور ہم ان امکانات سے شادی کر رہے ہیں جہاں وہ ان کا تعاقب کر سکتے ہیں، تو، آپ جانتے ہیں، تعلیم مختلف نظر آسکتی ہے،\nلیکن بنیادی، آپ جانتے ہیں، حقیقی شمالی ستارہ وہی رہتا ہے۔ ٹھیک ہے؟ - 100%\n- اور پھر ہم صرف، ہم اس کے بارے میں\nمختلف طریقوں سے چلتے ہیں، آپ جانتے ہیں۔ لیکن کیوں اب بھی وہاں ہے. ڈینومینیٹر اب بھی موجود ہے۔ اور یہ ہمارے بچے ہیں، یہ ہمارے طالب علم ہیں۔ اور اس لیے صرف آپ کا شکریہ، میرے خیال میں، ہم دونوں کی طرف سے،\nاس کو جیتنے کے لیے۔ - نہیں، ٹھیک ہے،\nاس کا حصہ بننے کے لئے آپ سب کا شکریہ۔ - اوہ، ارے-\n- وقت نکالنے کے لیے۔ - یہ والا۔\n- ارے ہان۔ - یہ اب تک کی سب سے اچھی چیز تھی۔ میرا مطلب ہے، میں تم سے مذاق نہیں کر رہا ہوں۔ میں بیٹھ کر اساتذہ اور بچوں کے ساتھ بات کر سکتا تھا\n جو اسے استعمال کر رہے تھے۔ میں سارا دن ان کے ساتھ بیٹھ سکتا تھا، اور میں، اور وہ مجھے وہ\nچیزیں بھیج رہے تھے جو وہ خانمیگو سے بنا رہے تھے، اور میں اسے پسند کر رہا تھا اور میرے پاس اور بھی کام ہیں، لیکن میں یہ پڑھنا چاہتا تھا کہ\nوہ اس کے ساتھ کیا کر رہے تھے۔ اور، آپ جانتے ہیں، میرے خیال میں، صرف تعریف، اور\nہمیں پائلٹ میں شامل کرنے کے لیے آپ کا شکریہ۔ مجھے لگتا ہے کہ ہم\nباہر جانے اور لوگوں سے اس بارے میں بات کرنے کے ساتھ ٹریل بلزرز ہوں گے کہ آپ جانتے ہیں کہ رکاوٹوں کو کیسے توڑا جائے\nاور اسے کیسے استعمال کیا جائے۔ لیکن آپ لوگوں کو ابتدائی شروعات دیے بغیر ایسا نہیں کر سکتے۔\n ٹھیک ہے؟ اور آپ نے ایسا کیا، اور\nمیں صرف آپ کو بتا رہا ہوں، \nان اساتذہ کے ساتھ بیٹھ کر بات کرنا دلچسپ ہے کہ وہ کیسے سوچتے ہیں کہ وہ اسے اگلا استعمال کریں گے۔ اور اس کے لیے آپ کا شکریہ۔ آپ نے کچھ لیا ہے جس سے مجھے لگتا ہے کہ وہ بہت ڈرتے تھے، خاص طور پر انگریزی اساتذہ سے۔ اور وہ اس سے خوفزدہ نہیں ہیں۔ اور اس طرح وہ جانتے ہیں کہ\nوہ اس تک کیسے پہنچیں گے۔ وہ ہیں، آپ جانتے ہیں، انہوں نے ہماری سیکرٹری\nتعلیم، کیٹی جینر سے بات کی، جو دلچسپ ہے کیونکہ\nآپ نے کیٹی جینر سے بات کی تھی اور وہ اس طرح ہیں، \"ارے، میں\nان اساتذہ سے بات کرنا چاہتی ہوں۔\" اور اس طرح ہم نے اسے قطار میں کھڑا کیا اور\nوہ بھی اس سے متوجہ ہوگئی۔ تو آپ نے کچھ لیا ہے اور\nہمیں تعلیم میں استعمال کرنے کے لیے ایک بہت اچھا ٹول دیا ہے۔ اور اس کے لیے، ہم اس کے شکر گزار ہیں، اور میں اگلا ورژن دیکھنے کا انتظار نہیں کر سکتا۔ - نہیں، ہم پرجوش ہیں، اور\nمجھے لگتا ہے کہ یہ اگلے چند مہینوں اور سالوں میں ہونے والی بہت سی بات چیت میں سے ایک ہوگی، جب ہم ایک ساتھ اس مہم جوئی پر جائیں گے۔ لیکن آپ کا شکریہ کیونکہ آپ جانتے ہیں، آپ جانتے ہیں، ظاہر ہے کہ ہم یہ سب کام کر سکتے ہیں، لیکن اگر ہم اسکول کے رہنماؤں، اساتذہ اور طلباء کی ضروریات کو پورا نہیں کر رہے ہیں، تو پھر ہم ایسا کیوں کر رہے ہیں؟ لہذا\nآپ سب کے ساتھ شراکت کرنے کے قابل ہونے کا بہت مطلب ہے۔ آپ سب کا شکریہ۔ - آپ کا شکریہ، سال.",
    "t_spanish": "- Hola a todos, soy Sal\nde Khan Academy y, como algunos de ustedes saben,\npubliqué mi segundo libro, \"Brave New Words\", sobre el futuro de la IA\nen la educación y el trabajo. Está disponible dondequiera que\npueda comprar sus libros. Pero como parte de la investigación para ese libro, hice algunas entrevistas con\npersonas fascinantes, que estás a punto de ver. Tengo dos invitados muy interesantes hoy. Tengo a la Dra. Peggy Buffington,\nque es la superintendente del distrito escolar de Hobart en Indiana, en el área metropolitana de Chicago\n, supongo que podemos decir. Y también tenemos al Dr. Tim Krieg, director de\nPlan de Estudios e Instrucción Secundaria en School City of Hobart. Bienvenidos a los dos. - Gracias por invitarnos hoy. - Si muchas gracias.\n- Así que déjame empezar. No, bueno, gracias por unirse y permítanme comenzar con\nuna pregunta muy básica, antes de entrar en algunas de las cosas en las que hemos estado colaborando durante los últimos meses. Cuando ChatGPT apareció en escena a\nfinales de noviembre de 2022, o principios de diciembre, y todos\nempezaron a aprender sobre él y tal vez a escuchar los rumores de que los estudiantes podrían\nestar usándolo para ensayos o para otras cosas, ¿cuáles\nfueron sus reacciones?  ?  ¿En qué estaban pensando?  ¿ Qué escuchabas de tus profesores? Y tal vez empiece por usted, Dr. Buffington. - Bueno, al principio, y sólo\npara darles algunos antecedentes en términos del uso de la tecnología, ya saben, comencé a leer todo\nlo que pude al respecto y a crear una cuenta, descubriendo sus complejidades. Y lo he abordado\nen el sentido en que lo haría con cualquier tipo de tecnología,\nque sería, vaya, cómo vamos a\nintegrar esto, usarlo y no tenerle miedo. Y creo que ese fue\nel enfoque más importante que pude adoptar, simplemente porque esto\nno es algo que, digamos, cuando apareció Google o cuando empezamos a introducir cómo usar Internet, la gente\nno lo hacía.  Realmente no tengo idea de cómo\nintegrarían eso con la enseñanza o con su plan de estudios. Así que inmediatamente comencé a pensar en cómo vamos a ayudar a que la\ngente vea esto como una herramienta y no puedan huir de ella. Y básicamente lo que realmente\npensé que iba a pasar es exactamente lo que pasó. Todo el mundo recurrió al plagio y ¿ vamos a hacer algo para bloquearlo? Y entonces pensé: \"\nEspera un segundo\". Intentemos averiguarlo, en primer lugar, sabíamos que debía tener\n18 años para usar ChatGPT, pero sabemos que eso no impide que los niños creen cuentas falsas. Y sabíamos que íbamos a\ntener este problema, y ​​tenemos que\naceptarlo y comenzar a descubrir cómo lo vamos a utilizar. Y, francamente, lo que es\nrealmente interesante, Sal, es que tuve un niño de segundo grado que creó su propio monstruo reciclado para un proyecto, y su padre lo ayudó a ir a ChatGPT para escribir una historia sobre ello. Entonces, si los estudiantes de segundo grado\nya van a usar esto, tenemos que ver que\nserá una herramienta que los niños adoptarán. Entonces, ¿cómo les enseñamos a\nutilizarla de forma ética y a que sea su voz, y no a huir de ella? Y esa fue nuestra posición\ndesde el principio. Pero puedo decirte que\ntodos los profesores decían: \"¿Qué vas a hacer para bloquearlo?\" Hasta que empezamos a tener\neste tipo de diálogo.  ¿ Por qué bloquearíamos algo que potencialmente podría ayudar a un estudiante? Sólo tenemos que aprender a\nusarlo, ¿verdad? - ¿Y cómo respondes? Porque muchas de\nesas preocupaciones son reales. Soy profesor de humanidades y estoy acostumbrado a asignar trabajos finales, y ahora los estudiantes pueden estar\nusando ChatGPT y, ya sabes, creo que no puedes detectarlo. Sé que hay gente que afirma que van a crear alguna tecnología, pero realmente no se puede detectar si alguien es siquiera vagamente\ncreativo al respecto.  ¿ Qué les ha estado diciendo a esos o han comenzado a cambiar la\npráctica dentro del distrito? Dr. Buffington, puede continuar y luego tengo mucha curiosidad, Tim, sobre cómo se siente acerca de estos temas. - Bueno, quiero decir,\nvoy a decir que hubo algunos profesores de inglés, como puedes imaginar, esos son los primeros en hablar y decir: \"Vaya, están afuera vigilando\". Y mira, creo que esto es\nesto y ejecuté este verificador. Y fue muy interesante\nver su enfoque al respecto. Y una de las cosas que\nrealmente creo es que tenemos que cambiar la forma en que\nasignamos las cosas a los niños. Y tendrás que\nmostrarles y enseñarles cómo usarlo apropiadamente. Porque tiene que haber discernimiento, tiene que haber uso ético de, ¿ es esta tu voz o la\nvoz de alguien más?  ¿ Y cómo se prueba que es\nverdad?, ¿cómo se cita? y todas esas cosas. Porque simplemente nos hace\nver las cosas de manera diferente. Ahora, no sé qué tan rápido quieres entrar en nuestras\nexperiencias con Khanmigo, pero lo que puedo decir es que\ncomenzamos a analizar, incluso antes de probar Khanmigo, ¿ cuál sería un uso aceptable de la IA? Y antes de comenzar a poner a prueba, en realidad se trataba de\nasegurarse de que hubiera discernimiento, de que \nrepresentáramos su voz y que no estuvieran simplemente copiando\ny pegando algo. Así que comenzamos a buscar\nquizás una rúbrica sin IA, con un poco de IA, y ¿\npara qué permitirían que se usara? Y luego, ya sabes, ¿cómo\nes la IA en toda regla?  ¿ Y vas a utilizar eso\npara el discurso y el debate? Entonces comenzamos a tener\nese tipo de conversación no solo para prohibirlo por completo, sino para hablar sobre lo que permitirían. Y luego creo que profundizaremos en lo que descubrimos con Khanmigo, pero ese es el tipo de diálogo que comenzamos a tener con la gente. - Muy útil. Y Dr. Krieg, ¿cuál es su\npunto de vista sobre ambos?  ¿ Cuál fue tu primera reacción\ncuando viste ChatGPT entrar en escena y qué\nhas escuchado de tus profesores y otras personas\nsobre cómo navegar por él? - Es una gran pregunta y, de hecho, es muy\ninteresante para mí porque el Dr. Buffington me hizo\nliderar un comienzo tardío, lo que, para nosotros, un comienzo tardío significa que todo nuestro personal está sentado junto y los estudiantes llegan tarde, por lo que podemos hacer cosas colectivas.\ndesarrollo profesional. Y no recuerdo exactamente en qué tenía trabajando al personal\n, pero al final, uno de nuestros profesores de ingeniería se\nme acercó y me dijo, y esto fue en noviembre\nde 2022, y me dijo: \"Oye  , Respondí a la pregunta \". Él dice: \"¿Qué opinas al respecto?\" Entonces lo leí y dije: \"Oh, muy bien hecho,\nDaniel, esto es genial\". Y él dice: \"Yo no lo escribí\". Y dije: \"Está bien\". Y esa fue mi primera\niteración real con ChatGPT que lo puso en el radar. Ahora, siendo\nexprofesor de inglés, sería negligente no decir en ese momento qué hice, ¿verdad? El Dr. Buffington habló sobre esto, me gustan los libros, puedes ver los libros detrás de mí.  A la Dra. Buffington le gustan los libros,\nlos tiene por todos lados. Empecé a investigar, ¿no? Y, francamente, creo que hay algo paralizante en lo que me gusta llamar\nacrónimo-itis, es decir, tenemos acrónimos para todo. Y así, ya sabes, disipar\nesta noción de qué es eso, ya sabes, ChatGPT\no cualquiera que sea el caso. Y descubres que todo esto está integrado en\nlo que se considera IA, ¿verdad? Inteligencia artificial. Y eso\nme llevó por un camino de conejo, por así decirlo, para\nver qué es la IA y si es nuevo o está en\nuna iteración diferente, ¿verdad? Así que pasé de no tener\nidea de qué era a leer, ya sabes,\nartículos sobre, ya sabes, los principales distritos escolares\ndel país, por ejemplo, que iban a prohibir esto, y demás. En ese momento me dije a mí mismo, bueno, ya sabes, eso es comprensible.  Es parte de la naturaleza humana, ya saben, supervivientes, tratar de protegernos a nosotros mismos, ¿verdad?, y levantar esos muros de protección. Bueno, cuanto más\nlo investigas, ya sabes, como exprofesor de inglés, sé que muchos de\nestos términos que usamos, como IA, por ejemplo, muchas veces se basan\nen cosas que son,  Ya sabes, relacionado con la ciencia ficción. Quiero decir, miras hacia\natrás a la IA y, ya sabes, es como \"El Mago de Oz\".  Ya sabes, Hombre de Hojalata, ¿verdad?  ¿ Es esto posible, ya sabes, que pueda tener un ser, por así decirlo, esta cosa creada que puede razonar, verdad? Y por eso es tan fascinante,\ncomo un hombre de hojalata sin corazón, ¿verdad? y el concepto de\nrobots con inteligencia artificial. Y miras hacia atrás y\nesto no es nada nuevo, ha adoptado una iteración diferente a medida que la tecnología se ha puesto al día. Entonces, ya sabes, comencé\na investigarlo y dije: \"Dios mío\".  Ya sabes, en la década de 1950, ya sabes, se hablaba de esto, ¿verdad? Y entonces los filósofos estaban\ntratando de explorar esto y había un, no\nrecuerdo el nombre del tipo, pero un matemático británico que trató de crear la\nposibilidad de, ya sabes, ¿hay pruebas de esto?\n-Alan Turing. - Sí. Y fue como, ves esto en\ntoda la ficción, ya sabes. Un pequeño cuento llamado\n\"El juego más peligroso\". Y, ya sabes, observar\na los animales y a los humanos y la capacidad de razonar\ncomo diferenciador. Y entonces, ya sabes, el problema\nera, como todos sabemos, que la tecnología no estaba lista, ya\nsabes, en ese momento. Entonces ves esto como una noción completa de inteligencia artificial que acaba de pasar por\ndécadas de cambios, ¿verdad? Era como una montaña rusa. Estaba arriba y abajo y por todos lados. Y entonces, ya sabes, eso\nobviamente condujo a la era actual en la que nos encontramos, donde la tecnología puede mantenerse al día, ¿verdad? Y ahora vemos este\ncambio social en el que, de repente,\nel profesor de ingeniería está usando esta cosa, pero ni\nsiquiera sé qué es, ya sabes, acrónimo, ChatGPT. Y que haces? Pones tus setos\nde protección, ¿verdad? No sé qué\nes esto y da miedo, ¿verdad? Y entonces creo que una de\nlas cosas más importantes hasta ese momento fue, ya sabes, tan pronto como tuvimos esa\nconversación, ya sabes, entonces, como la Dra. Buffington,\ncomo líder que es, ella ya sabía sobre esto. Llegué tarde a la fiesta, ¿verdad? Pero luego empezamos a\nresolver problemas juntos y a pensar y explorar. Y creo que lo que hace que\neste distrito sea único y por qué valoramos la\nasociación que tenemos con Khan y por qué creo que estamos en\nla línea con ustedes en este momento es simplemente porque, ya saben,\nlo de \"Brave New Words\". Ya sabes, la Dra. Buffington es una pionera y no tiene miedo de ver las cosas de una manera no binaria, ¿verdad? Tener o no tener, bueno o malo.  ¿ Qué pasa con las zonas grises, verdad? Y estas son herramientas como las calculadoras. Miras los cambios en\nel nuevo SAT digital, ya sabes. Tienen una\ncalculadora con infusión de Desmos, es decir, ya no existe tal cosa para el nuevo SAT de una calculadora\no ninguna sección de calculadora. Bueno, esta es la realidad en la que nos encontramos, y no necesariamente\ntiene que ser distópica si podemos, como señala el Dr. Buffington, trabajar\ncon nuestro personal y estudiantes para ser administradores sabios de estos recursos, porque no va a  cambiar, ¿verdad? Entonces creo que para mí, ya sabes, la Dra. Buffington en su\ndisertación, ya sabes, ¿ con qué se empieza,\nuna definición de términos? Y entonces, cuando empiezas a investigar cosas, empiezas a darte cuenta de que estamos hablando de lo\nmismo, ¿verdad?  ¿ Estamos definiendo nuestros términos o simplemente estamos dando vueltas y\nvueltas sobre cosas que ni\nsiquiera entendemos qué son?  ¿ Bien? - Bien, ¿puedo entrar\nallí por un segundo? Porque una de las cosas, como usuario de tecnología en\nel pasado, en los años 80, ya sabes, hice mi\npasantía en Apple Computer en diseño instruccional, y  , ya sabes, y estás tratando de descubrir cómo lograr que los profesores\nadopten la tecnología y no le tengan miedo. Y realmente tienes que decirte a ti mismo, lo primero que\nquieren saber es, ¿ cómo mejorará esto mi trabajo?  ¿ Cómo va a ayudar a mis alumnos? Y si no puedes venderles eso, mejor olvídalo. Entonces, si puedes venderles que mejorará su trabajo y hará que los logros sean más\naccesibles para sus estudiantes, y ellos están de acuerdo con eso, entonces tienes que diseñar un buen plan para enseñarles cómo usarlo.  . Y entonces, lo que realmente siento, una de las primeras cosas\nque es tan emocionante es cuando empiezas a hablar con ellos al respecto, es simplemente crear una cuenta, ¿verdad?  ¿ Quieres saber cómo\nhacer la mejor carbonara? Haga esa pregunta, ¿verdad?,\ny vea lo que obtiene. Y les fascina. Es como usar el motor de búsqueda por primera vez,\nencuentras todos estos resultados y luego dices: \"Bueno,\ntienes que perfeccionarlo para obtener lo que quieres\". Entonces puedes regenerar preguntas, ¿verdad? Y entonces encuentran fascinantes estas pequeñas\ncosas, y luego se toman esos pequeños pasos adicionales para mostrarles cosas como cómo\ngenerar un boleto de salida. Y luego empiezan\na ver un poco de uso y dicen: \"¡Guau!\" Un ejemplo de ello es el profesor de ingeniería que\nestaba hablando con el Dr. Krieg, se acerca y dice: \"Vaya, acabo de entregar mi beca de la Fundación Educativa Hobart y lo escribí todo en ChatGPT\". Y por supuesto se lo concedieron. Tuvo que entrar y modificar algunas cosas y dijo: \"Fue increíble\". Y nosotros dijimos, está bien, buen trabajo, le encontraste un uso. Mi director de tecnología\ny mi encargado de TI, nuestro sistema de gestión de estudiantes, algo no funcionaba bien en un informe que tenían que hacer. Se retrasaron en el back-end y algo de código que pensaron que estaba mal, lo pusieron en\nChatGPT, y luego regresó y lo corrigió. Pudieron\ncorregirlo y dijeron: \"¡Guau!\" Nuestro director de servicio de alimentos, viendo algo que tenían que hacer para un informe federal, salió y estaba haciendo\nalgunas cosas en ChatGPT. Ahora bien, como todos sabemos,\nno es el final de todo. Todavía tienen que revisar las cosas y tener discernimiento, ¿verdad? Entonces, el punto es que,\ncuando introduces esto, ya sean términos o lo que sea, si no puedes mostrar algún gran beneficio, te desanimarás. Y luego creo que el otro aspecto de esto es enseñar a los maestros una vez que\nven el lado de los recursos, porque, francamente, el lado de los recursos es\nrealmente excelente para los maestros cuando comienzan a mirarlo, ¿ cómo hago tareas que utilicen este tipo?  ¿de tecnología? Ya sabes, y pienso en\nesa narrativa, ese ensayo, y, ya sabes, cuando pienso\nen las habilidades del siglo XXI para colaborar con un equipo y tener ese discurso\ny debate sobre, ya sabes, ¿ qué\nte dice la inteligencia artificial? Y luego te regeneras\ny obtienes otra respuesta y otra respuesta,\ny estás en ese equipo y estás discutiendo y\ndebatiendo qué es exacto, qué es real, qué es posible, y luego comienzas a formular algún tipo de hipótesis o\ntemática.  tipo de situación en la que vas a ampliarlo. Creo que tiene un gran potencial cuando enseñamos a la gente\ncómo utilizarlo adecuadamente. Y tenemos que mirar hacia el futuro y decir: van a hacer esto. Nuestros competidores a nivel mundial\nvan a utilizar esto.  ¿ Por qué demonios prohibiríamos algo? Y luego\nsaldrán al mundo real y lo utilizarán. Así que es nuestro trabajo usarlo y usarlo bien. Enséñeles el uso ético, enséñeles cómo usarlo estratégicamente para obtener un producto final. Entonces creo que nuestros profesores\nnecesitan ese tipo de ayuda. Y para empezar, ¿ en qué me beneficia como profesor? Y ahora, ¿cómo voy a\nusar esto con mis hijos? Y tengo, ya sabes,\ntengo algunas ideas realmente geniales sobre cómo podemos usar esto\ncon los niños, solo con, me encanta el aspecto de entrenamiento, me encanta la diferenciación, pero eso es más del lado de Khanmigo, y yo  Sé que\nllegarás a eso con nosotros, porque amo a Khanmigo. Sólo digo. - No, quiero decir, obviamente,\nsoy parcial, amo a Khanmigo, pero me entusiasmo más cada vez que hablo con usted, Dr. Buffington. Y, para quienes escuchan, varias de las características del maestro son ideas directas del Dr. Buffington. Así que sus comentarios\ndefinitivamente se manifiestan en nuestro producto. Pero cambiemos de tema a eso, porque Hobart ya era un distrito que estaba bastante comprometido,\nmuy comprometido con el uso de, llamémoslo Academia Khan anterior a la IA. Luego les mostramos las\nprimeras demostraciones de Khanmigo y, desde marzo, han\nsido uno de los primeros distritos del país, probablemente\ndel mundo, en utilizar Khanmigo de manera sistemática, y\nparece que de manera productiva.  ¿ Cuáles fueron sus\nreacciones originales ante Khanmigo?  ¿ Qué preguntas o aspiraciones\ntienes todavía al respecto?  ¿ Y cómo ha sido la experiencia durante los últimos meses? Empezaré con usted, Dr. Buffington, y luego iré con el Dr. Krieg. - Bueno, me encanta el aspecto de\nconfianza en un estudiante, ¿verdad? Quiero decir, cualquier cosa que quieras leer sobre el rendimiento de los estudiantes tiene que empezar por desarrollar la confianza que tienen dentro de sí mismos, que saben que pueden hacerlo. Entonces, nuestro trabajo es asegurarnos de equiparlos con las habilidades que puedan manifestar y tener este nivel de confianza. Y una de las cosas que antes de la COVID, y luego ahora podemos\npasar a la COVID, es que comenzamos a notar que los niños realmente no hacen preguntas. No quieren levantar la mano. Y luego eres el\nmaestro que intenta atraer, solicitas,\ncreas ganchos, intentas involucrar a los niños. Es difícil. Y, sin embargo, puedo ir a una escuela primaria y ¿qué veo\nhacer a los niños en una Chromebook, un iPad, lo que sea? Automáticamente\nsalen y presionan el micrófono: \"Muéstrame una serpiente azul y\ndime por qué es azul\".  ¿ Bien? Y les encanta ese tipo de cosas. Y por eso son muy propensos\na hablar con su dispositivo y les encanta la respuesta que reciben, y luego les entusiasma un\npoco más preguntar y ser un poco más específicos. Entonces, una de las cosas que me encanta de ver esto con Khanmigo\nes ese tutor, esa guía lateral y los niños que no tienen miedo de\nhacerle preguntas al dispositivo. Y creo que es ingenioso porque se sientan y hacen\npreguntas todo el día. Y si tienen una\ntarea que esté orientada, digamos que es escribir el ensayo. Y sabes, Sal, cuando hablé por primera vez contigo, te vas a reír de esto, pero estabas hablando de que tu hijo tenía que escribir un ensayo, ¿verdad? Entonces solo tenía cinco maestros\nque estaban pilotando esto, pero aún así estoy tan emocionado que estoy hablando con todos al respecto, ¿verdad? Yo digo: \"No creerías\nlo que nos mostró Sal Khan\". Y luego tuve una estudiante\na la que estaba asesorando en la escuela secundaria y ella me dijo: \"Dr. Buffington, ¿\nya está listo ese material de IA?\" Porque necesitaba un profesor de escritura, ¿verdad? Y entonces pensé, bueno, fingiré ser IA como Khanmigo, y dije: \"Seré tu entrenador de escritura\". Y estaba tratando de fingir que preguntaba, formularía una pregunta como si pensara que la IA funcionaría, y no que reemplacé a\ntu Khanmigo, Sal. Pero esto es lo que puedo decirte. Escribió un ensayo de seis párrafos\nsobre el misterio y fue hermoso. Necesitaba esa ayuda adicional simplemente para hacer preguntas\ny obtener respuestas, y empujarla un poco. Y fue hermoso. Y una de las cosas que nos dijeron los profesores, ¿qué tan bueno es tener un tutor\n, un asistente o un entrenador cuando no estoy disponible? Y les encantó\nporque vieron a sus, y estos son\nprofesores de secundaria que dijeron: \" No me levanto a las dos de la mañana cuando terminan de jugar Minecraft\" y deciden empezar a\nescribir su trabajo y boom, tienen una enseñanza.  asistente, hacen preguntas\ny vienen a la escuela y se sienten seguros en su trabajo. Y entonces creo que esa\nes la belleza de esto. Ahora, todavía\nregresaré como su educador y me aseguraré de que hayan\npresentado su solicitud y que sea su voz y que representen\nlo que les he asignado. Pero vaya, el\nnivel de confianza en los niños es asombroso. Y eso es lo que me gusta de él.  En cualquier momento puedes tener un\ntutor en ese mismo momento, y creo que esa\nes la mejor parte. Creo que los comentarios que hemos podido brindarte, que has mejorado aún más el programa, son todo el historial de chat, ¿verdad? Entonces puedo ver cuánto tiempo han estado involucrados, qué tipo de preguntas están haciendo, y no es solo una especie de copia y pegado rápido. Realmente estás ahí fuera\nusando discernimiento, refinando y haciendo las preguntas correctas para realizar un gran trabajo. Me encanta esto sobre esto. Cuestionamiento, tutoría,\nfomento de la confianza. Eso es todo lo que queremos para nuestros estudiantes. - Sabes, escucho dos\ntemas realmente poderosos allí. Uno es el\naspecto de generar confianza, que en la introspección tiene\ntodo el sentido del mundo. Si los estudiantes pueden\ntener más confianza y obtener respuestas a sus preguntas,\nse involucrarán más. Y luego el otro,\nal que acaba de aludir, que es el proceso sobre solo el resultado. Y creo que, curiosamente, la IA nos da una perspectiva del proceso\nque nunca antes habíamos tenido, porque no vas a\nver lo que hace un estudiante a las dos de la mañana mientras\nescribe su ensayo, y  Podría ser conseguir que\nsu hermana mayor se lo escriba\no algo así. Y ahora tienes una lente. Dr. Krieg, ¿qué hay de usted?  Ya sabes, ¿cuál fue tu\nreacción inicial ante Khanmigo, especialmente en relación con\ntu reacción ante ChatGPT, y cómo ha sido la experiencia hasta ahora? - Esa es una gran pregunta. Sabes, francamente,\ncuando sabes que puedes ir a todo\ntipo de talleres y leer libros y, ya\nsabes, es útil. Te da una chispa. Pero, ya sabes, es como, ¿\ncómo tomo esa chispa y realmente permito que esa chispa adquiera una naturaleza orgánica, hasta el punto de que simplemente se incrusta en la forma en que haces las cosas, verdad? Hablamos de cultura,\nhablamos de clima. Y veo cosas como, ya\nsabes, equidad y acceso y, ya sabes, hablamos de\npérdida de aprendizaje y hablamos del efecto Matthew, ¿verdad? Los que tienen siguen teniendo\ny los que no tienen, no.  ¿ Cómo llenamos esa brecha y realmente brindamos oportunidades?  Ayer estuve en un taller\ncon un colega y estábamos viendo\nel nuevo SAT digital, y mi colega, que es\neducadora y madre involucrada, dijo: \"Bueno, ya sabes,\nestaba trabajando con mi hija y,  \"Sabes, ella no entendía esto, aquello y lo otro.\" Entonces, ya sabes, dije,\nbueno, podemos conseguirte un tutor, ya sabes, y dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. Y realmente me hizo\npensar en esto otra vez, porque es como, ¿qué pasa con Khanmigo? Bueno, según su punto\ny el del Dr. Buffington, hemos estado en\nla pista de Khan Academy durante mucho tiempo. Lo he usado desde la perspectiva de un estudiante, una perspectiva de maestro y\nahora, a través de los distritos de Khan, una perspectiva administrativa. Pero lo que estoy viendo con Khanmigo es la capacidad de tomar\nlas ideas que tiene la gente y realmente llevarlas a un lugar sistémico. Y eso creo que a medida que nos alejamos\nmás y más de la memoria de memoria,\ncomenzamos a ver líneas borrosas. Quiero decir, nuestros estudiantes son\ncreadores, son productores, son compositores, son cantantes, son podcasters, ¿verdad? Son curadores, consumidores de medios e información,\npero también los crean.  ¿ Y entonces qué se necesita para todo eso?  Se necesita mayor profundidad\nde conocimiento, complejidad e interacción con materiales, ¿verdad? Interactuar con conceptos, etcétera. Bueno, el problema es que, si\npiensas en el efecto Matthew y, ya sabes, en la\ncapacidad de algunas situaciones socioeconómica y culturalmente, mediante las cuales son capaces de llenar vacíos, identificarlos y financiarlos, ¿\nqué pasa con todos los demás?  ¿ Qué pasa con aquellos que no tienen acceso a ese tipo de cosas? E incluso si lo hacen, ¿\nqué pasa si no funciona? Y entonces escuchamos todo sobre la apatía y la falta de\ncompromiso de los estudiantes y, cualquiera que sea el caso, y\nesta es una pregunta que haré. Diré, está bien, digamos que captamos la\natención de sus alumnos. Tienes una audiencia cautivada.  ¿ Qué vas a hacer con él? Vamos a darle la vuelta al guión, ¿verdad? Y entonces creo que lo que es emocionante para mí es que a medida que usamos este modo beta de Khanmigo, y mientras observamos con\nél, vemos a los estudiantes interactuando con el conocimiento y los conceptos de una manera que aumenta la complejidad de lo que están haciendo.  . Y no es una interacción, no es una, la mejor manera de decirlo\nsería una transacción, ¿verdad? No es sólo un, está bien,\nnecesito esto, dame aquello. Es una relación continua mediante la cual los estudiantes\ninteractúan con material nuevo, se desafían a sí mismos o amplían lo que\npensaban que era cierto. Y esa readmisión al aprendizaje es lo que a todos nos apasiona, ¿verdad? Así que aquí hablamos mucho sobre cómo encontramos formas de\nunir pasiones, propósitos, posibilidades, etc. Y entonces, cuando miro a Khanmigo,\nal punto del Dr. Buffington, si soy profesor, no soy\nprofesor para ti, ¿verdad?  ¿ Pero qué puede hacer? Puede ayudar a actualizar el conocimiento. Puede, ya sabes, crear ganchos\ny asociarse con el maestro para crear ganchos, ¿verdad? Puede ayudar al profesor\ncreando billetes de salida con ellos. Puede ayudar con la planificación de lecciones. Puede darte, ya sabes,\nincluso hay una pequeña característica interesante en la que puedes tomar una lección completa y convertirla en un\npequeño poema divertido, ¿verdad? Puedes co-crear rúbricas y\ntodo ese tipo de cosas, ¿verdad? Objetivos de aprendizaje, utilícelo como herramienta para el punto del Dr. Buffington. Y luego, del lado del alumno. Adelante. - Eso, quiero decir, algunas\nde las cosas más emocionantes que descubrieron durante el piloto\n, que se podía hablar con una figura literaria.  ¡ Oh Dios mío! O podrías hablar con alguien\nhistóricamente y luego, simplemente lo puso en el momento y le dio vida al aprendizaje. Y por eso es tan atractivo.  Ya sabes, cuando pienso\nen, durante años hemos dicho, diferenciación, ya sabes, ese fue uno de los\naspectos más importantes de Khan Academy. Y como usted ha dicho, y\ncomo ha dicho el Dr. Kreig, estábamos usando Khan Academy,\nfuimos los primeros en adoptarla.  Me encantó. Teníamos el nuestro, incluso hicimos nuestro propio\ndiccionario de Khan Academy, fue bastante divertido saber cómo usarlo.  ¿ Pero qué me gustó de eso? Me gustó que hubiera diferenciación. Había una guía al\nlado, algo de ayuda adicional, ¿verdad? Y veo a Khanmigo exactamente eso, pero también lo veo totalmente atractivo. Entonces puedo verlo, guau,\ndiferenciación y, como educador, realmente\nno tuve que hacer mucho para brindar esa diferenciación. Y es una guía al lado. Pero del mismo modo, no es algo que\nlos niños no quieran hacer.  Les gusta. Ahora, uno de nuestros profesores de inglés, y yo me reí totalmente con esto, es que uno de los niños dijo, y estaba interactuando\ncon una figura histórica con Khanmigo, y el niño dijo: \"Esto es más divertido que TikTok\". Entonces Sal, lo lograste. Es más esclarecedor que TikTok. Y cuando los niños te dicen eso, sabes que tienes algo ahí. Pero de todos modos, creo que\neso es una gran ventaja con esto. Aquí no es donde simplemente tengo que\nhacer mi tarea.  De hecho, están ahí fuera, se\ninvolucran con ello y lo llevan a nuevos niveles. Y descubrimos que algunos de los niños que formaban parte del\npiloto estaban haciendo cosas que no formaban parte de su tarea. Estaban creando cosas,\ncreando empresas similares y creando estos escenarios. Fue simplemente histérico. No les pedimos que hicieran eso. Simplemente les gustó mucho. Y creo que eso\nes lo que queremos para los niños. Queremos que se pregunten. Queremos que innoven. Queremos que\nsolucionen problemas y salgan, tomen la información\ny hagan algo con ella. Y eso es lo que realmente pasó con esto. Pienso, nuevamente, que es\nhermoso simplemente regresar y mirar, como\neducador, el historial de chat, así sé lo que están\nhaciendo, puedo ver la seguridad, puedo ver su trabajo, etcétera, eso es realmente importante.  a los educadores. Pero creo que esto ha\nabierto un significado completamente diferente al compromiso y ¿qué se preguntan, sobre qué quieren saber más y qué quieren hacer con ello? Y encuentro que los\nniños a los que servimos hoy, creo que tienen\nun corazón para otras personas y son capaces de resolver problemas. Creo que\ntienen un ser emprendedor, ya sabes, que\nquieren hacer cosas y quieren tener éxito en ello, quieren que sirva a otras\npersonas, resuelvan problemas y quieren tener éxito\ncon lo que hacen.  he hecho. Este es un gran\ncambio en materia de equidad. Y creo que el Dr. Krieg lo\ndijo bastante bien. Puedo tomar a un estudiante de inglés, lo cual probamos con nuestro maestro de EL, y simplemente un cambio de juego para ellos. Quiero decir, su lengua materna no es un obstáculo para ellos. Están a la par de sus compañeros de clase. Y eso es bastante asombroso. Una de las cosas también es que estamos hablando con nuestro maestro de química AP, también un maestro universitario de doble crédito, simplemente mirando algunas de las ecuaciones que estaban haciendo en química. Y, ya sabes, Khanmigo\nno les dio la respuesta, pero les estaba investigando\ncómo obtener la respuesta. Y a nuestros profesores les encantó eso, ¿sabes? Si estás en casa tratando\nde resolver ese problema y no pueden ayudarte, Khanmigo\nestuvo allí para ayudarlos. Ahora, les diré\nque todos dijeron que a veces los niños comenzaban a intimidar a la IA porque solo querían la\nrespuesta y no la funcionaba. Eso hizo que los profesores estuvieran muy contentos. Sólo para que sepas que hay\nalgunos comentarios para ti.  A veces había un poco de intimidación\ncon Khanmigo, y, ya sabes,\nseguía incitándolos y decía: No te voy a dar la respuesta. - Sí, tenemos que enseñar...\n- Nos gustó esa parte. - Creo que la\nregla de oro debería aplicarse a la IA. Trate a la IA como desearía que lo\ntrataran a usted mismo. Quiero decir, simplemente continuar\ncon esa lente de retroalimentación. Y no estaba bromeando cuando, ya\nsabes, en nuestra última reunión, tenemos varias funciones en Khanmigo que surgieron directamente de esa reunión. Así que voy a seguir\nescogiendo el cerebro de todos ustedes.  Ya sabes, algunas de las cosas en las\nque estamos trabajando más allá de lo que\nya estás experimentando. Estamos trabajando para dotar a la\ninteligencia artificial de Khanmigo de un sentido de memoria, para que sepa el tono que prefiere un profesor o un alumno. Recuerda conversaciones anteriores y puede continuar donde las dejaste. Estamos agregando cosas\ndonde los profesores pueden asignar a través de Khanmigo tanto\nactividades tradicionales de Khan Academy como actividades de IA. Y potencialmente afinar la\nactividad, en lugar de decir \"Habla con personajes históricos\". Como, \"Oye, quiero que\nhables con Benjamin Franklin y averigües lo siguiente\". Y entonces vamos a\nhacer cosas así. Ya tenemos un poco de esto, pero tendremos más sobre informes, donde Khanmigo realmente actúa\ncomo asistente de enseñanza. Mencionaste a los estudiantes de inglés. Acabamos de publicar que ahora\nfunciona en todos los idiomas principales. Entonces, un estudiante podría estar haciendo matemáticas o química en inglés, pero podría recibir\nayuda o tutoría en español, portugués, hindi o cualquier idioma que necesite. Y luego, la otra cosa\nque esperamos hacer, llamémoslo en los próximos\nseis meses, es tener IA, tener actividades que sean multiusuario, facilitar el\naprendizaje colaborativo entre muchos estudiantes. Entonces, ya sabes, puedes imaginar que,\nen lugar de tener un debate con la IA, tal vez la IA\npodría facilitar un debate con varios estudiantes. O realizar un diálogo socrático\ncon varios estudiantes o realizar una simulación o un\njuego con varios estudiantes. Así que me encantaría que sus\npensamientos fueran, ya saben, lo que ya existe de esa\nlista de la que les acabo de hablar, tal vez les entusiasme mucho.  ¿ Alguna idea sobre cómo modificarlo?  ¿Tiene alguna inquietud y, en cuanto al riesgo, qué le gustaría ver más?  ¿Los hay? ¿Ha\nvisto problemas que desea\nasegurarse de que podamos abordar para que las cosas vayan mejor? Empezaré por usted, Dr. Buffington. - Bueno, creo que una de las\ncosas sobre las que dimos retroalimentación es que, obviamente, a veces nos damos cuenta de cosas que son preocupaciones de seguridad para nosotros. Y creo que usted abordó, ya sabe, inmediatamente comenzó a investigar cómo podemos asegurarnos de que si existe algún tipo de riesgo para un estudiante o para otras personas con lo que nosotros, haya un sistema de indicadores.  Por eso, apreciamos mucho\nque haya recibido esos comentarios, porque muchas veces podemos recogerlos en clase o en algún trabajo o cuerpo de trabajo, o si un estudiante ha estado hablando con otro estudiante o un maestro.  , podemos detectar algunas señales de cosas que indican que un estudiante puede necesitar ayuda adicional porque está pasando por\nun momento muy malo. O simplemente existe la\nposibilidad de que se produzca una aplicación incorrecta o\nalgo por el estilo. Entonces, creo que tomó\nbastante bien nuestros comentarios en términos de que nos preocupamos por los niños que pueden necesitar\napoyo socioemocional adicional, o si su seguridad se ve\ncomprometida en su hogar o con otras personas. Creo que esa fue una\nde nuestras mayores preocupaciones cuando iniciamos el piloto por primera vez. Porque tenemos cosas\nasí en este momento, y veo que los niños usan\nKhanmigo más que, quiero decir, creo que lo usarán mucho. Y si van a usarlo mucho, me gusta que hayan incorporado\nalgunas medidas de seguridad. Eso fue realmente importante para nosotros. En términos de seguir adelante, creo que el compromiso y la comunicación con otras personas son realmente importantes. Muchas gracias por la parte de lenguaje que acaba de crear, porque creo que es de\nvital importancia en este momento. Y simplemente diría, una de las cosas que\ncreo que es realmente importante, y creo que esto se remonta\na la vieja pregunta, y realmente recibimos esto de los\nniños de secundaria más que de nadie, como, ¿por qué\ntengo que aprender?  ¿eso? Y creo que\nsi pudiéramos tener expertos en el campo, además de que la parte de IA sea tan experta, cuando dices que pueden comunicarse con otros estudiantes, me encantaría ver una base de datos\no, además del experto en IA, Me gustaría ver\nexpertos en el campo. Porque muchas veces, cuando estamos\npreparados para la universidad y la carrera, y pensamos en estos,\nnuestros próximos líderes serán, ya sabes, hablar con la\ngente y comprender a qué se dedican\ny cómo podría estar cambiando, y todo el concepto de IA.  . Permítanme darles un punto final del caso. Entonces, ahora mismo, cuando piensas\nen informática, y hablamos de codificación y simplemente intentamos que los\nniños se dediquen a la codificación y la informática,\nahora será diferente. La IA le da un sabor completamente diferente y creo que es\nnecesario hablar con ellos, además del experto en IA, ¿ quiénes son esas personas en el campo? Como tu gente.  ¿ Cómo funciona esto detrás de escena?  ¿ Y qué? ¿Quieres ganarte la\nvida con esto? Y si realmente lo disfrutas,\nni siquiera es un trabajo. Pero creo que es\nnecesario que haya más de eso. Y entonces, ya sabes, existe\nsoftware con el que puedes reunirte con un\nexperto aquí, un experto allá. Pero darles a los niños un sabor real. Y luego, quiero decir, todavía puedes, si les vas a permitir que se\nreúnan con otros niños, me gustaría verlos\nreunirse con otros expertos en el campo. - Es una idea fascinante. Creo que todos saben que tenemos\notra organización hermana sin fines de lucro que comencé durante la\npandemia llamada schoolhouse.world, que, y toda la premisa\nde schoolhouse.world es, ya saben, conectar\nel mundo a través del aprendizaje y brindar a las personas tutorías en vivo gratuitas a\ntravés de  video conferencia. Y la forma en que lo hacemos es\naprovechando los voluntarios. Muchos de los voluntarios son\nestudiantes de secundaria o universitarios, pero muchos de ellos son profesionales. Y cuando lanzamos\nKhanmigo empezamos a pensar, bueno, tal vez Khanmigo podría\nser un puente interesante entre la Khan Academy tradicional y tal vez algo\ncomo schoolhouse.world, donde en realidad\naparecen personas reales. Y entonces, Peggy,\ncasi estoy pensando en tu idea, ¿y si en schoolhouse.world,\ncreo que a la mayoría de los profesionales les encantaría retribuir de alguna manera? Les encantaría contarles, ya\nsabes, la mayoría de los padres, cuando regresan a casa, quieren contarles a sus hijos sobre su trabajo y sus hijos no están interesados. Pero los niños podrían estar interesados\nen los trabajos de otros padres, lo que suele ser el caso. Entonces, podría haber una forma divertida en la que puedas aparecer en\nestos, digamos en una escuela, y luego Khanmigo pueda decir, oye, te preguntabas por qué esto es importante. Hay una sesión que está sucediendo. Fulano de tal está mostrando\nquién es un investigador de IA, o quién es médico, o quién es\nabogado, quién puede hablar sobre, ¿ por qué no vas a eso? y\naprenderás mucho más sobre por qué esta álgebra es  útil. Entonces me encanta esa idea. Dr. Krieg, más ideas,\nsiga viniendo, no podemos... - Sí, no, yo... -\nY miedos y riesgos, porque esas también son\nideas que, ya sabes, oportunidades para que podamos mejorarlas. - Entonces, francamente, para\nsalirme de esa nota, recuerdo que cuando era estudiante no entendía por qué\nShakespeare, por ejemplo. Y, ya sabes, en la universidad,\ncuando era estudiante universitario y luego de posgrado y todo eso, comencé a\napreciarlo de manera diferente. Pero, irónicamente, al punto del Dr. Buffington, lo que realmente comenzó\nfue este breve video con el que me topé, donde había actores y actrices que hablaban sobre por qué Shakespeare. Y por primera vez\ncomencé a ver el teatro, por ejemplo, no solo en\nsu propia realidad aislada, como, oh, esto es teatro,\nsino como un puente, por así decirlo, como mencionaste, hacia todo\ntipo de otras ocupaciones.  . Y cuando puedas ver y escuchar cómo las cosas son híbridas ahora, las cosas ya no están aisladas,\npuedes estar en un tema y aplicar los conceptos, los\nprincipios, las experiencias, no solo a otras cosas\nque estás haciendo.  Actualmente, pero las posibilidades son infinitas porque realmente no sabemos cómo\nsucederá más adelante, ¿verdad? Ni siquiera siempre somos\nconscientes de ello. Entonces, cuando pienso en\nlas actividades actuales para los estudiantes dentro de, a través de Khanmigo, los animo a\ncontinuar buscando formas de romper los silos. Y con esto quiero decir, ya sabes,\nson como modos de escribir.  Los modos de escritura durante demasiado\ntiempo se enseñaron de una manera singular. Entonces es como si esto fuera escritura expositiva, esto es escritura argumentativa,\nesto es escritura narrativa. Pero, ya sabes, las investigaciones muestran\nque el proceso de escritura de nuestros autores más exitosos refleja el de los niños pequeños antes de pasar por un\nsistema educativo tradicional K-12, debido exactamente a lo que\nhablamos antes. Curiosidad.  ¿ Es una disciplina? Seguro. Lea a Stephen King sobre la escritura, él le dirá que es una\ndisciplina, es una ciencia, pero tiene que haber esa pasión. Entonces, para mí, pienso en\ncuál es la diferencia entre lo que hemos hecho, lo que estamos haciendo y lo que podríamos y deberíamos hacer. Lo que tenemos que empezar a hacer, lo que\npodríamos y deberíamos hacer, es derribar los muros entre las clases, derribar los muros entre\ndentro y fuera de la escuela. El Dr. Buffington podría decirles que las cosas más exitosas que estamos\nsucediendo en este momento han sido orgánicas y\nluego se vuelven sistemáticas, donde el\nprofesor de ingeniería se asocia con el profesor de negocios, quien se asocia con el\nprofesor de biomedicina PLTW. Porque están alineados con las pasiones. Están alineados con las cosas que\nte interesan. Entonces, si me fijo en algo\ncomo elaborar una historia, comprender cuándo sales, lees y escuchas podcasts, parte de la argumentación\nes contar historias, ¿verdad? No existe tal cosa como, oh,\nesto es escritura expositiva, así que solo expongo información, ¿verdad? Escribir es complicado. El proceso de escritura no es lineal. Todo evoluciona y cambia.  En cuanto al punto del Dr. Buffington\n, hay dos cosas aquí. Primero, aplicar estos temas de una manera que los haga cada vez más fluidos, y es por eso que me encanta tu comentario, Sal, sobre hacer que el viaje sea algo que se construye sobre sí mismo. Y si la capacidad de la IA es tal que permite que\ncontinúe la progresión del aprendizaje, eso es un cambio de juego. Tuve una de mis mejores\nprofesoras de composición en la escuela de posgrado, ella habló sobre cómo, ya sabes, la escritura debería evaluarse en última instancia\n, no en estos pequeños, ya sabes, oh, bueno,\ntomaste esta clase y obtuviste una A o aquella clase y  obtuvo una B. Debería ser dónde\ncomenzaron los estudiantes y luego dónde terminaron en el final natural del segmento. Y se trata de ese crecimiento. Bueno, ese crecimiento es tal que\nempiezas a entender, ay, todo es retórico, ¿no? Vuelve a Platón, ya\nsabes, a Sócrates, a Aristóteles, cualquiera que sea el caso,\ntodo es retórico. Bueno, nuestros estudiantes ahora se\npresentan a un mundo que es gigantesco, pero\ntambién puede ser un nicho, ¿verdad?  ¿ Cómo podemos tomar estas cosas que están aprendiendo sobre\nhistoria, tecnología, ingeniería, ya\nsabes, el cuerpo humano, todas estas cosas diferentes y decir, esto podría aplicarse a campos\nque ni siquiera existen? Esto podría terminar aplicándose,\npodría quedar pegajoso, ¿verdad? Así es como funciona nuestro cerebro. Necesitamos incluir información en cosas sobre las que ya tenemos marcos construidos, de tal manera que ahora estoy combinando algo que estoy haciendo en clase\ncon el trabajo secundario que tengo, ya sabes, una tienda que hago\nal mismo tiempo.  o lo que sea, y también en casa en mis preferencias\npersonales y, ya sabes, y como sea el caso. Entonces, por ejemplo, si escucho\npodcasts sobre cosas relacionadas con los deportes, eso\npuede cambiar la forma en que hago una\nsesión grabada para el personal, porque me gusta la forma en\nque presentan esto o aquello.  , ya sabes, usa la inflexión de voz allí y todo eso. Por tanto, mi aliento sería doble. Primero, continuar derribando\nesos silos para mostrar cómo todo esto encaja\nen otras cosas, ¿verdad? Y luego dos, hay un\npoco ahora en Khanmigo, en lo que se refiere a cómo\nnavegar las admisiones universitarias y la ayuda financiera, ya sabes, y luego también el aspecto profesional. Entonces yo diría que\nlos animo a continuar conectando a los estudiantes y\nlo que están aprendiendo o podrían aprender y con qué. Y cuando piensas en\nel estado de Indiana, por ejemplo, mucho de lo que el Dr.\nBuffington, yo y nuestro equipo estamos haciendo aquí es ayudar a alinear\nlo que los estudiantes están haciendo ahora con credenciales acumulables de moneda, mostrando futuros empleadores,\ncomités de becas,  etcétera, que tengo dominio de algo\no competencia en algo o experiencia en algo. Vemos esto incluso con insignias digitales y cosas de esa naturaleza. Entonces, cuando un estudiante ve una carrera profesional, se siente intimidante porque\nel lenguaje que se utiliza para caracterizarla puede\nno tener nada que ver con lo que realmente implica la ocupación. Y las ocupaciones futuras\npara las que puedo usar estas cosas ni siquiera existen, ¿verdad? Entonces, ¿cómo podemos intentar\nunir esos mundos para conectar a los estudiantes\npresentes con su futuro en el corto plazo, así como, ya sabes, las oportunidades\nque existen a partir de entonces y que ni siquiera conocemos todavía? - Me encanta, este tipo de tema de romper barreras entre temas, que creo que ahora es\nmás factible que nunca. Y luego también entre la\nescuela y el mundo real. Una última pregunta para usted, Dr. Buffington. Avancemos rápido, no\nsé, dos, tres años. No tiene que pasar mucho tiempo, pero las cosas están cambiando muy rápido.  ¿ Crees que todo lo que\nhemos hablado va a alterar de alguna manera fundamentalmente\ncómo es la escuela, incluso, ya sabes, ni siquiera hablamos de\ncosas como la evaluación, en la que estamos empezando a\npensar de nuestra parte?  ¿ O crees que será simplemente\nun buen complemento a la arquitectura existente?  ¿ O cree que de alguna manera cambia fundamentalmente el aula\n, Dr. Buffington? - Bueno, quiero decir, Tim lo\nsabrá, Dr. Krieg. Quiero decir, tenía la filosofía\nde que, ya sabes, durante COVID, el panorama\ncambió para siempre, ¿verdad? Quiero decir, ya ha cambiado. Si no quiero venir\na mi institución pública y sentarme todo el día, puedo elegir\nir a una escuela en línea y, ya sabes, tal vez eso funcione para mí. Creo que, cuando miro esto, no quiero verlo como algo complementario. Quiero ver esto como una herramienta\nque es, ya sabes, utilizable ahora, pero que también puede\nayudarnos en el futuro.  Ya sabes, cuando pienso en cosas y pienso en la\npreparación para una carrera universitaria, y, ya sabes, ahora mismo puedo dejar que un niño\nsalga temprano, se gradúe temprano y, ya sabes, tengo\nniños que se están graduando con títulos asociados en\nnuestra escuela secundaria en este momento.  ¿ Qué veo que podría suceder aquí? Veo lo que la gente quiere con los niños que ahora se gradúan de la escuela secundaria. Quieren que solucionen problemas. Quieren que puedan\ncolaborar y trabajar en equipo. Quieren que tengan\nprácticas éticas detrás. Y creo que ya\ntienes el potencial con esto. Ahora lo interesante es cómo le doy una pasantía a un estudiante, y tal vez en Khanmigo haya\nun aspecto de pasantía de esto y cuente para su día. Sabes, me refiero a\nreinventar la escuela secundaria y cómo se ve eso. Y, ya sabes, creo que\neso se canaliza hasta, ya sabes, la escuela secundaria y la primaria. Creo que hay muchos\naspectos diferentes de esta IA que podría explorar. Sabes, cuando pienso que los\nniños quieren divertirse, no quieren temer las tareas, ya veo que esa parte está curada. Veo niños que van allí\nsólo porque quieren y les gusta hacer preguntas. Y eso es lo que queremos como educadores. Queremos que hagan preguntas. Y les fascina. Y por eso quiero tomar esa\nfascinación y desarrollarla. Y si eso significa rediseñar\nla forma en que hacemos escuela, entonces tenemos que hacerlo, ¿verdad?  Por eso, ya estamos rediseñando y reinventando nuestras\nescuelas secundarias con universidad temprana y, ya sabes, puedes obtener\ncertificaciones de la industria un año de universidad, dos años de universidad. No es necesario que\nvayas cinco días a la semana. Quizás no necesites ir un día entero. Porque puedes tener una\noportunidad diferente. Y si esa oportunidad\nse presenta de esa manera, estás acreditado para graduarte y tal vez incluso ingresar a la fuerza laboral o ingresar a la educación postsecundaria para explorar más a fondo lo que estamos tratando de\nlograr con, ya sabes, alguna credencial postsecundaria que contribuya.  al mundo. Y entonces mi pregunta es: ¿\nexisten formas mejores, más eficientes o más\nemocionantes y atractivas de reinventar las cosas que estamos haciendo? Y creo que, como todo lo que ha\nsido nuevo en la educación, a veces somos los últimos en adoptarlo.  ¿Y entonces por qué? Y creo que empezamos a hablar de esto.  Le tienen miedo. Y no hay que tenerle miedo, hay que aceptar lo que es el futuro. Entonces creo que\nhabrá cierta adaptabilidad cuando se habla de\nsuplementos, ¿verdad? Quiero decir, ahora mismo\ntendrás usuarios pioneros que básicamente tomarán algo que tienen en su\nmapa curricular y dirán: \"¿Cómo me ayuda la IA?\". \"¿Cómo puedo utilizar Khanmigo?\" Y luego\ncomenzarás a ver algo pionero en el que será como, vaya,\nno lo soy, no es un reemplazo. Y verán que\ncomienzan a usarlo de una manera que mejora aún más, y no reemplaza como lo hicieron antes. Y está empujando a los niños\na crecer y aprender y tal vez a tener una idea\nde que podrían curar algo. Sabes, me encanta el hecho\nde que esta es una generación a la que le gusta resolver problemas. Y dirán: \"¿Qué pasa con esto?\" O \"¿Qué pasa con eso?\" Y creo que esto tiene\nel potencial para lograrlo. Entonces, si tengo un estudiante y, ya sabes, para hablar sobre lo que estábamos hablando, pondremos a los niños en una clase de biomedicina y luego les pediremos que se enfrenten al programa de ingeniería, porque están pensando en una cosa y  Estas son las personas aquí que realmente pueden construirlo para usted o ayudarlo con sus\ncálculos o lo que sea. Esas barreras están rotas. Y veo que la escuela secundaria\nse reinventa por completo al brindarles a los niños la\noportunidad de aplicar esto en un entorno del mundo real. Entonces creo que hay espacio para esto, y solo les daré\nun concepto de, ya saben, Indiana está haciendo algo con las\ncuentas de becas profesionales.  Se llaman CSA. Y en realidad está destinado a incorporar a los\nniños a la fuerza laboral y al aprendizaje y las pasantías en el trabajo.  ¿ Y ya están en la cúspide de cómo sería un diploma de escuela secundaria para un niño al que le damos este CSA?  ¿ Y es realmente lo tradicional? Tienes que tener 40 créditos\nde esto y aquello. Y están empezando a ver, bueno, eh, tal vez no necesiten eso. Y tal vez, solo tal vez\nsea alguien que yo incluya en la fuerza laboral que tenga algún conocimiento sobre el\nuso apropiado de la tecnología y que encuentre una solución para algo que han estado luchando por encontrar. Creo que existe el potencial para eso. Creo que veremos a los\nprimeros usuarios complementar, reemplazar y luego encontrar cosas nuevas. Y luego creo que verás a\nniños decir: \" Puedo hacer esto, puedo hacer aquello\". Y tendremos que reconsiderar\nla forma en que estamos cumpliendo para permitir el crecimiento, si eso tiene sentido. - Tiene mucho sentido. Y saben, podría hablar\ncon ustedes dos durante horas, especialmente sobre este tema,\nporque es muy fascinante. Pero me encanta ese tipo de\nempujón final en el que, ya sabes, se rompen todos los límites y, de hecho, siempre obtenemos nuestras ideas y actividades de usted, Dr. Buffington. Y de alguna manera reforzó algo que estábamos pensando, es decir, ¿ qué pasaría si hubiera una\nactividad para los estudiantes, o para los maestros o para cualquier persona, para resolver grandes problemas en el mundo? Sabes, nos necesitas,\nnecesitas abordar el clima, ¿ quieres descubrir\ncómo puedo yo, como estudiante, comenzar a abordar el cambio climático?  ¿ Cómo puedo yo, como estudiante,\nempezar a abordar la investigación del cáncer?  ¿ Cómo puedo yo, como estudiante,\nempezar a abordar, no sé, cualquier problema del mundo que\ncreas que necesita solución? Muchos estudiantes quieren hacerlo, pero no saben por dónde\nempezar, por dónde empezar, así que a mí también me gusta esa idea. Bueno, gracias a ambos... Y Sal puede, Sal, puedo\nsimplemente mencionar lo que acabas de decir y\nlo importante que es, y ellos tratan de resolver cosas\nque son tan importantes para ellos. Entonces, durante COVID, uno de mis\nestudiantes estaba tratando de descubrir cómo tener un mejor\nsistema de registro de síntomas en la sala de emergencias. - Mmm.\n- Y por qué. Quería que les notifique que deben volver a priorizar\nquién está en su sala de emergencias, porque su abuelo murió de COVID. Entonces tuve a este pequeño\nemprendedor innovador, y tenemos espacios para creadores\naquí, ya sabes, hacemos ferias de fabricantes, tenemos espacios STEM en todas partes. Y su creación fue, y trabajó con los\ningenieros del hospital sobre los síntomas y dónde se encuentran, y cómo priorizamos a quién vas a\nver primero, porque era muy real para ella y para ti.  Ya sabes, cuando\nhablas de cambio climático, las cosas que realmente les importan las pasan todo el día. Ese es el tipo de estudiante\nque no se va a la cama porque está ahí afuera\ntratando de descubrir dónde está la información,\nqué tipo de herramienta, qué tipo de instrumento. Ella está en la clase de biomedicina, va a la clase de ingeniería y están creando una computadora de mano, y se sincronizará\ncon relojes o lo que sea en el hospital, para cambiar\nla prioridad de, ¿a quién necesitas ver ahora? Y creo que nuestros hijos\ntienen ese potencial, ¿verdad? Y entonces, ¿adivinen qué? Eso\nno sucedió en su salón de clases, sucedió fuera de su salón de clases, pero ella trajo al salón de clases que tiene que haber una manera mejor.  ¿ Bien?  Por eso creo que esto\nabre todo tipo de vías de preguntas o problemas\nque quieren resolver, les da un buen comienzo y les hará querer\nseguir adelante.  ¿ Usted sabe lo que quiero decir? Y creo que esa es la belleza de esto. Es tan atractivo que no quieren parar: 100%. No podría estar más de acuerdo.\n- Sal, si me permites. Solo en nombre de ambos, ya\nsabes, gracias por, ya sabes, eso es lo que hiciste, ¿verdad? Empezaste identificando\nun problema, una necesidad, cierto, que era personal para\nti en un sentido familiar. Y hiciste muchas\npreguntas y fuiste pionero, y luego, ya sabes, aquí estamos, ¿verdad? Y entonces, nuestra esperanza es que, por muy apasionados que seamos los tres\n, por ejemplo, por la educación y, ya sabes, Khanmigo, y las diferentes formas de\ntratar de ayudar a nuestros estudiantes, ya sabes, tener una misión, poder  para perseguir sus pasiones. Si pueden tener el mismo tipo de pasión por las cosas que les interesan, y estamos uniendo las posibilidades donde pueden perseguirlas, entonces, ya sabes, la educación puede verse diferente,\npero lo fundamental, ya sabes,  La verdadera Estrella Polar sigue siendo la misma.  ¿ Bien? - 100%.\n- Y luego simplemente lo hacemos de\ndiferentes maneras, ya sabes. Pero el por qué sigue ahí. El denominador sigue ahí. Y esos son nuestros hijos, esos son nuestros estudiantes. Y creo que gracias en nombre de ambos\npor defender esto. - No, bueno, gracias a todos\npor ser parte de esto. - Oh, oye...\n- Por tomarte el tiempo libre. - Éste.\n- Oh sí. - Esto fue lo mejor que jamás haya sucedido. Quiero decir, no estoy bromeando. Podía sentarme y hablar con\nlos profesores y los niños que estaban usando esto. Podía sentarme con ellos todo el día, y ellos me enviaban\ncosas que estaban creando a partir de Khanmigo, y me encantaba y tengo otro trabajo que hacer, pero quería leer lo que\nestaban haciendo con eso. Y creo que simplemente felicitaciones y gracias por\nincluirnos en el piloto. Creo que seremos\npioneros al salir y hablar con la gente sobre cómo, ya sabes, cómo romper las barreras\ny cómo utilizarlas. Pero no se puede hacer eso\nsin darle a la gente un comienzo inicial.  ¿ Bien? Y lo hiciste, y\nsolo te digo que es fascinante sentarse y\nhablar con estos profesores sobre cómo creen que lo usarán a continuación. Y gracias por eso. Has tomado algo que creo que les tenía tanto miedo, especialmente los profesores de inglés. Y no le tienen miedo. Y entonces saben cómo\nlo abordarán. Ellos, ya sabes, hablaron con nuestra Secretaria\nde Educación, Katie Jenner, lo cual es interesante porque\nhablaste con Katie Jenner y ella dijo: \"Oye, quiero\nhablar con esos maestros\". Así que lo alineamos y a\nella también le fascinó. Así que tomaste algo y\nnos diste una herramienta realmente buena para usar en educación. Y por eso, lo agradecemos y no puedo esperar a ver la próxima versión. - No, estamos entusiasmados y\ncreo que esta será una de muchas conversaciones durante los próximos meses y años, a medida que emprendamos esta aventura juntos. Pero gracias porque sabes, obviamente podemos hacer todo este trabajo, pero si no atendemos las necesidades de los líderes escolares, los maestros y los estudiantes, entonces ¿por qué hacemos esto? Significa mucho\npoder asociarnos con todos ustedes. Gracias a todos. - Gracias, Sal.",
    "t_arabic": "- مرحبًا بالجميع، سال\nهنا من أكاديمية خان، وكما يعلم البعض منكم، فقد\nأصدرت كتابي الثاني، \"كلمات جديدة شجاعة\"، حول مستقبل الذكاء الاصطناعي\nفي التعليم والعمل. إنه متاح أينما\nيمكنك شراء كتبك. ولكن كجزء من البحث لهذا الكتاب، أجريت بعض المقابلات مع\nبعض الأشخاص الرائعين، والتي أنت على وشك مشاهدتها. لدي ضيفان مثيران للغاية اليوم. لدي الدكتورة بيجي بوفينجتون،\nوهي المشرفة على منطقة مدرسة هوبارت في ولاية إنديانا، في منطقة شيكاغو الكبرى\n، أعتقد أنه يمكننا القول. ولدينا أيضًا الدكتور تيم كريج، مدير\nالمناهج والتدريس الثانوي في مدرسة مدينة هوبارت. مرحبا بكم في كل واحد منكما. - شكرا لاستضافتكم لنا اليوم. - نعم، شكرا جزيلا لك.\n- لذلك اسمحوا لي أن أبدأ. لا، حسنًا، شكرًا لانضمامك، واسمحوا لي أن أبدأ بسؤال\nأساسي جدًا، قبل أن ندخل في بعض الأشياء التي كنا نتعاون معها خلال الأشهر القليلة الماضية. عندما ظهر ChatGPT في\nنهاية نوفمبر 2022، أو أوائل ديسمبر، وبدأتم جميعًا في\nالتعرف عليه وربما سمعتم شائعات مفادها أن الطلاب ربما\nيستخدمونه في المقالات أو لأشياء أخرى، ماذا\nكانت ردود أفعالكم جميعًا؟  ؟ ما الذي كنتم تفكرون فيه؟ ماذا كنت تسمع من معلميك؟ وربما أبدأ معك يا دكتور بافينغتون. - حسنًا، في البداية، وفقط\nلإعطائكم بعض المعلومات الأساسية فيما يتعلق باستخدام التكنولوجيا، كما تعلمون، بدأت في قراءة كل\nما أستطيع حولها وإنشاء حساب، واكتشاف تعقيداتها. وقد تناولت الأمر\nبمعنى أنني سأفعل ذلك، مع أي نوع من التكنولوجيا،\nوالذي سيكون، واو، كيف\nسندمج هذا، ونستخدمه، ولا نخاف منه. وأعتقد أن هذا هو\nالنهج الأكثر أهمية الذي يمكنني اتباعه في التعامل مع الأمر، فقط لأن هذا\nليس شيئًا، دعنا نقول فقط، عندما ظهر Google أو عندما بدأنا لأول مرة في تقديم كيفية استخدام الإنترنت،\nلم يعرفه الناس  ليس لدي أدنى فكرة عن كيفية\nدمج ذلك مع التدريس أو مع مناهجهم الدراسية. لذلك بدأت على الفور بالتفكير في كيفية مساعدة\nالأشخاص على رؤية هذا كأداة ولا يمكنهم الهروب منها. وما اعتقدت حقًا أنه\nسيحدث هو ما حدث بالضبط. تحول الجميع إلى الانتحال وهل سنفعل شيئًا لمنع ذلك؟ ولذلك كنت أقول، \"مهلًا،\nانتظر ثانية واحدة فقط هنا.\" دعونا نحاول معرفة، أولاً وقبل كل شيء، كنا نعلم أنه يجب أن يكون عمرك\n18 عامًا لاستخدام ChatGPT، لكننا نعلم أن هذا لا يمنع الأطفال من إنشاء حسابات مزيفة. وكنا نعلم أننا\nسنواجه هذه المشكلة معها، وعلينا أن\nنتقبلها ونبدأ في معرفة كيف سنستخدمها. وبصراحة تامة، الأمر المثير\nللاهتمام حقًا يا سال، هو أنه كان لدي طالب في الصف الثاني قام بصنع وحشه المعاد تدويره لمشروع ما، وقد ساعده والده في الذهاب إلى ChatGPT لكتابة قصة عنه. لذا، إذا كان طلاب الصف الثاني\nسيستخدمون هذا بالفعل، علينا أن نرى أن هذه\nستكون أداة سيتبناها الأطفال. فكيف نعلمهم\nكيفية استخدامه بشكل أخلاقي، وهو صوتهم، وعدم الهروب منه؟ وهكذا كان هذا موقفنا\nمنذ البداية. لكن يمكنني أن أخبركم أن\nجميع المعلمين كانوا يقولون، \"ماذا ستفعلون لحظره؟\" حتى بدأنا في إجراء\nهذا النوع من الحوار. لماذا نحظر شيئًا يمكن أن يساعد الطالب؟ علينا فقط أن نتعلم\nكيفية استخدامه، أليس كذلك؟ - وكيف ترد؟ لأن عددًا كبيرًا من\nهذه المخاوف حقيقي. أنا مدرس العلوم الإنسانية وأنا معتاد على تعيين أوراق الفصل الدراسي، والآن قد\nيستخدم الطلاب ChatGPT وهم، كما تعلمون، أعتقد أنك لا تستطيع اكتشافه. أعلم أن هناك أشخاصًا يزعمون أنهم سيصنعون بعض التكنولوجيا، لكنك حقًا لا تستطيع اكتشافها إذا كان شخص ما\nمبدعًا بشكل غامض بشأنها. ماذا كنتم تقولون لهؤلاء أو هل بدأتم جميعًا في تغيير\nالممارسة داخل المنطقة، والدكتور بافينغتون، يمكنك الاستمرار وبعد ذلك أشعر بالفضول حقًا، يا تيم، لمعرفة ما تشعر به تجاه هذه القضايا. - حسنًا، أعني،\nسأقول أنه كان هناك بعض مدرسي اللغة الإنجليزية، يمكنك أن تتخيل، هؤلاء هم أول من تحدثوا وقالوا، \"واو، إنهم خارج الشرطة.\" وانظر، أعتقد أن هذا هو\nهذا وقمت بتشغيل هذا المدقق. وكان من المثير للاهتمام\nرؤية نهجهم في التعامل مع هذا الأمر. وأحد الأشياء التي أؤمن بها\nحقًا هو أنه يتعين علينا تغيير الطريقة التي\nنخصص بها الأشياء للأطفال. وسيتعين عليك أن\nتبين لهم وتعلمهم كيفية استخدامه بشكل مناسب. لأنه يجب أن يكون هناك تمييز، ويجب أن يكون هناك استخدام أخلاقي، هل هذا صوتك أم\nصوت شخص آخر؟ وكيف تثبت أن هذا\nصحيح، وكيف تستشهد به، وكل هذه الأشياء. لأنه يجعلنا\nننظر إلى الأشياء بشكل مختلف. الآن، لا أعرف مدى السرعة التي تريد بها الدخول في\nتجاربنا مع خانميغو، ولكن ما يمكنني قوله هو أننا\nبدأنا النظر، حتى قبل تجربة خانميغو، ما هو الاستخدام المقبول للذكاء الاصطناعي؟ وقبل أن يبدأوا بالتجريب، كان الأمر يتعلق\nبالتأكد من وجود تمييز، والتأكد من أننا\nنمثل صوتك وأنك لا تقوم فقط بنسخ\nولصق شيء ما. لذلك بدأنا بالنظر إلى نموذج\nتقييم لا يحتوي على الذكاء الاصطناعي، وقليلًا من الذكاء الاصطناعي، وما الذي\nستسمح باستخدامه من أجله؟ وبعد ذلك، كما تعلمون، كيف\nيبدو الذكاء الاصطناعي الكامل؟  وهل ستستخدم ذلك\nفي الخطاب والنقاش؟ لذلك بدأنا نوعًا ما في إجراء\nهذا النوع من المحادثة ليس فقط لحظره تمامًا، ولكن للحديث عما ستسمح به. وبعد ذلك أعتقد أننا سنتعرف أكثر على ما اكتشفناه مع خانميجو، ولكن هذا نوع من الحوار الذي بدأناه مع الناس. - مفيدة للغاية. والدكتور كريج، ما هي\nوجهة نظرك في كل منهما؟ ما هو رد فعلك الأول\nعندما رأيت ChatGPT يظهر على الساحة وماذا\nسمعت من معلميك والآخرين\nحول كيفية التنقل فيه؟ - إنه سؤال رائع، وهو في الواقع\nمثير للاهتمام حقًا بالنسبة لي لأن الدكتور بافينغتون جعلني\nأقود بداية متأخرة، وهو ما يعني البدء المتأخر بالنسبة لنا، حيث يجلس جميع موظفينا معًا ويتأخر الطلاب، حتى نتمكن من القيام بعمل جماعي\nالتطوير المهني. ولا أتذكر بالضبط ما الذي كان فريق العمل\nيعمل عليه، ولكن في النهاية، جاء إلي أحد مدرسي الهندسة لدينا\nوقال، وكان هذا في نوفمبر\nمن عام 2022، وقال، \"مرحبًا  ، لقد أجبت على السؤال.\" إنه مثل ، \"ما رأيك في ذلك؟\" ولذلك قرأته وقلت، \"أوه، أحسنت يا\nدانيال، هذا عظيم.\" فيقول: \"أنا لم أكتب ذلك\". فقلت: \"حسنًا\".  وكان هذا أول\nتكرار حقيقي لي مع ChatGPT والذي وضعه على الرادار. الآن، كوني\nمدرسًا سابقًا للغة الإنجليزية، سأكون مقصرا إذا لم أقول في تلك المرحلة ما الذي فعلته، أليس كذلك؟ تحدث الدكتور بافينغتون عن هذا الأمر، فأنا أحب الكتب، ويمكنك رؤية الكتب خلفي. الدكتورة بافينغتون تحب الكتب،\nفهي تمتلكها في كل مكان. لقد بدأت بالبحث، أليس كذلك؟  وكما تعلمون، بصراحة تامة، أعتقد أن هناك شيئًا معوقًا بشأن ما أحب أن أشير إليه باسم\nالاختصار، مما يعني، كما تعلمون، لدينا اختصارات لكل شيء. وهكذا، كما تعلمون، تبديد\nفكرة مثل، ما هو ChatGPT\nأو أيًا كانت الحالة. وتكتشف أن كل هذا يتم تضمينه في\nما يعتبر ذكاءً اصطناعيًا، أليس كذلك؟ الذكاء الاصطناعي. وهذا\nأخذني إلى حد ما في طريق أرنب، إذا صح التعبير، كما تعلمون،\nللنظر في ما هو الذكاء الاصطناعي وهل هذا جديد أم أنه في\nنسخة مختلفة، أليس كذلك؟ لذلك انتقلت من عدم وجود\nأي فكرة عما كان عليه الأمر إلى قراءة، كما تعلمون،\nمقالات حول المناطق التعليمية الرئيسية في\nالبلاد، على سبيل المثال، التي كانت ستحظر هذا، وما إلى ذلك. في تلك المرحلة قلت لنفسي، حسنًا، كما تعلمون، هذا أمر مفهوم. إنها الطبيعة البشرية، كما تعلمون، أيها الناجون، أن نحاول حماية أنفسنا، صحيح، ووضع سياج الحماية. حسنًا، كلما\nنظرت في الأمر أكثر، كما تعلم، كمدرس سابق للغة الإنجليزية، أعلم أن الكثير من\nهذه المصطلحات التي نستخدمها، مثل الذكاء الاصطناعي على سبيل المثال، تعتمد في كثير من الأحيان\nعلى أشياء،  تعرف، الخيال العلمي ذات الصلة. أعني، أنك تنظر\nإلى الذكاء الاصطناعي، وكما تعلم، فهو مثل \"ساحر أوز\". كما تعلم يا تين مان، أليس كذلك؟ مثل، هل هذا ممكن، كما تعلمون، أنه يمكن أن يكون لدي كائن، إذا صح التعبير، هذا الشيء المخلوق الذي يمكنه التفكير، أليس كذلك؟ ولذا فهو رائع جدًا،\nمثل Tin Man بلا قلب، صحيح، ومفهوم\nالروبوتات ذات الذكاء الاصطناعي. وعندما تنظر إلى الوراء تجد أن\nهذا ليس شيئًا جديدًا، لقد تم أخذه في نسخة مختلفة مع تطور التكنولوجيا.  وهكذا، كما تعلمون، بدأت\nالنظر في الأمر وقلت: \"يا إلهي.\"  كما تعلمون، في الخمسينيات من القرن الماضي، كان يتم الحديث عن هذا الأمر، أليس كذلك؟ ولذلك كان الفلاسفة\nيحاولون استكشاف هذا وكان هناك، لا\nأتذكر اسم الرجل، لكن عالم رياضيات بريطاني حاول خلق\nإمكانية، كما تعلمون، هل هناك دليل على ذلك.\n- آلان تورينج. - نعم. وكان الأمر كما لو كنت ترى هذا في\nجميع أنحاء الخيال، كما تعلم. قصة قصيرة صغيرة بعنوان\n\"اللعبة الأكثر خطورة\". وكما تعلمون، فإن النظر\nإلى الحيوانات والبشر والقدرة على التفكير\nهو ما يميزهم.  وهكذا، كما تعلمون،\nكانت المشكلة، كما نعلم جميعًا، أن التكنولوجيا لم تكن جاهزة\nفي ذلك الوقت.  وهكذا ترى هذا مثل فكرة الذكاء الاصطناعي التي مرت\nبعقود من التغييرات، أليس كذلك؟ لقد كانت مثل قطار الملاهي. كان صعودا وهبوطا وفي كل مكان. وهكذا، كما تعلمون، من\nالواضح أن ذلك أدى إلى العصر الحالي الذي نعيش فيه، حيث يمكن للتكنولوجيا مواكبة ذلك، أليس كذلك؟ وهكذا نرى الآن أن هذا\nيشبه التحول المجتمعي حيث فجأة يستخدم\nمدرس الهندسة هذا الشيء، لكنني\nلا أعرف حتى ما هو، كما تعلمون، الاختصار، ChatGPT. وماذا تفعل؟  لقد وضعت سياج الحماية الخاص بك\n، أليس كذلك؟ مثل، أنا لا أعرف ما هذا\nوهو مخيف، أليس كذلك؟ ولذا أعتقد أن أحد\nأهم الأشياء في تلك المرحلة كان، كما تعلمون، بمجرد إجراء تلك\nالمحادثة، كما تعلمون، مثل الدكتورة بوفينجتون،\nباعتبارها القائدة، كانت تعرف بالفعل عن هذا الأمر.  لقد تأخرت عن الحفلة، أليس كذلك؟ ولكن بعد ذلك نبدأ في\nحل المشكلات معًا والتفكير والاستكشاف. وأعتقد أن ما يجعل\nهذه المنطقة فريدة من نوعها ولماذا نقدر\nالشراكة التي لدينا مع خان ولماذا أعتقد أننا على\nالخط معك الآن هو فقط لأنه، كما تعلمون،\nيتعلق بـ \"كلمات جديدة شجاعة\".  كما تعلمون، الدكتورة بافينغتون رائدة وهي لا تخشى النظر إلى الأشياء بطريقة غير ثنائية، أليس كذلك؟ لديك أو لا تملك، جيدة أو سيئة. ماذا عن المناطق الرمادية، أليس كذلك؟ وهذه أدوات مثل الآلات الحاسبة تمامًا. أنت تنظر إلى التغييرات التي طرأت على\nSAT الرقمي الجديد، كما تعلم. لديهم\nآلة حاسبة مملوءة بـ Desmos، لم يعد هناك شيء من هذا القبيل بالنسبة لقسم SAT الجديد للآلة الحاسبة\nأو لا يوجد قسم للآلة الحاسبة. حسنًا، هذا هو واقع ما نحن فيه، وليس من الضروري أن يكون الأمر \nبائسًا إذا استطعنا، حسب وجهة نظر الدكتور بافينغتون، العمل\nمع موظفينا وطلابنا ليكونوا مشرفين حكيمين على هذه الموارد، لأنه لن يحدث ذلك  التغيير، أليس كذلك؟ ولذلك أعتقد بالنسبة لي، كما تعلمون، د. بوفينجتون في\nأطروحتها، بماذا تبدأ،\nتعريف المصطلحات؟ ولذا عندما تبدأ في البحث عن الأشياء، تبدأ في إدراك، هل نتحدث عن\nنفس الشيء، أليس كذلك؟ هل نحدد مصطلحاتنا أم أننا نتجول\nوندور وندور حول أشياء لا نفهم\nحتى ما هي؟ يمين؟ - حسنًا، هل يمكنني أن أتدخل\nهنا لثانية واحدة فقط، لأن أحد الأشياء، باعتباري مستخدمًا للتكنولوجيا في\nالماضي، في الثمانينيات، كما تعلمون، لقد قمت\nبتدريبي مع شركة Apple Computer في التصميم التعليمي، و  كما تعلمون، وأنت تحاول معرفة كيفية جعل المعلمين\nيتبنون التكنولوجيا، وليس الخوف منها.  وعليك أن تقول لنفسك، أول شيء\nيريدون معرفته هو، كيف سيجعل هذا وظيفتي أفضل؟ كيف سيساعد طلابي؟ وإذا لم تتمكن من بيعها على ذلك، فربما تنساها أيضًا. وبالتالي، إذا تمكنت من إقناعهم بأن ذلك سيجعل عملهم أفضل ويجعل الإنجاز أكثر\nسهولة لطلابهم، وهم متفقون على ذلك، فيجب عليك وضع خطة جيدة لتعليمهم كيفية استخدامها  . ولذا فإن ما أشعر به حقًا، أحد الأشياء الأولى\nالمثيرة للاهتمام بشأن هذا الأمر هو عندما تبدأ بالتحدث معهم حول هذا الموضوع، هو مجرد إنشاء حساب، أليس كذلك؟  هل تريد أن تعرف كيفية\nصنع أفضل كاربونارا؟ اطرح هذا السؤال، صحيح،\nوانظر ما ستحصل عليه. وهم مفتونون به. إنه مثل استخدام محرك البحث لأول مرة،\nوتحصل على كل هذه النتائج ثم تقول، \"حسنًا،\nعليك تحسينه للحصول على ما تريد.\" لذا يمكنك إعادة طرح الأسئلة، أليس كذلك؟ ولذلك يجدون هذه\nالأشياء الصغيرة رائعة، ثم تتخذ تلك الخطوات الإضافية الصغيرة لتُظهر لهم أشياء مثل كيفية\nإنشاء تذكرة خروج. وبعد ذلك بدأوا\nيرون القليل من الفائدة وسيقولون، \"قف!\" مثال على ذلك، مدرس الهندسة الذي\nكان يتحدث مع الدكتور كريج، جاء وقال، \"رائع، لقد قمت للتو بتسليم منحة مؤسسة هوبارت التعليمية الخاصة بي، وكتبت كل ذلك في ChatGPT.\" وبالطبع حصل عليها. كان عليه أن يدخل ويعدل بعض الأشياء، وقال: \"لقد كان رائعًا\". ونحن نقول، حسنًا، عمل رائع، لقد وجدت فائدة له. مدير التكنولوجيا الخاص بي\nومسؤول تكنولوجيا المعلومات ونظام إدارة الطلاب لدينا، لم يكن هناك شيء يعمل بشكل صحيح في التقرير الذي كان عليهم القيام به. لقد تأخروا في النهاية الخلفية وبعض التعليمات البرمجية التي اعتقدوا أنها خاطئة، ووضعوها في\nChatGPT، ثم عادوا وقاموا بتصحيحها.  وكانوا قادرين على تصحيح\nذلك، وقالوا: \"رائع!\" مدير خدمة الطعام لدينا، وهو ينظر إلى شيء كان عليهم القيام به من أجل تقرير فيدرالي، خرج وكان يقوم ببعض\nالأشياء في ChatGPT. الآن، كما نعلم جميعًا، هذه\nليست النهاية.  لا يزال يتعين عليهم التحقق من الأمور والحصول على التمييز، أليس كذلك؟ إذن النقطة المهمة هي أنه\nعندما تقوم بتقديم هذا، سواء كان مصطلحًا أو أي شيء آخر، إذا لم تتمكن من إظهار بعض الفوائد العظيمة، فسيتم إيقافك. وبعد ذلك أعتقد أن الجانب الآخر من هذا هو تعليم المعلمين بمجرد أن يرون\nجانب الموارد هذا، لأنه، بصراحة تامة، جانب الموارد\nرائع حقًا للمعلمين عندما يبدأون في النظر إليه، كيف يمكنني إنشاء مهام تستخدم هذا النوع  التكنولوجيا؟  كما تعلمون، وأنا أفكر في\nهذا السرد، وتلك المقالة، وكما تعلمون، عندما أفكر\nفي مهارات القرن الحادي والعشرين مع التعاون مع فريق وإجراء مثل هذا الخطاب\nوالنقاش حول، كما تعلمون، ما الذي\nيخبرك به الذكاء الاصطناعي؟ ومن ثم تتجدد\nوتحصل على إجابة أخرى وإجابة أخرى،\nوتكون ضمن هذا الفريق وتناقش \nوتناقش ما هو دقيق، وما هو حقيقي، وما هو ممكن، ثم تبدأ في صياغة نوع من الفرضية أو\nالموضوع  نوع الموقف الذي ستتوسع فيه. أعتقد أن لديها إمكانات كبيرة، عندما نعلم الناس\nكيفية استخدامها بشكل مناسب. وعلينا أن ننظر إلى المستقبل ونقول إنهم سيفعلون ذلك.  سوف يستخدم منافسونا على مستوى العالم\nهذا. لماذا في العالم نحظر شيئًا ما؟ ومن ثم\nسيخرجون إلى العالم الحقيقي ويستخدمونه. لذا فإن مهمتنا هي أن نستخدمها ونستخدمها بشكل جيد. علمهم الاستخدام الأخلاقي، وعلمهم كيفية استخدامه بشكل استراتيجي للحصول على منتج نهائي. لذلك أعتقد أن معلمينا\nبحاجة إلى هذا النوع من المساعدة. وهكذا تبدأ، كيف يفيدني ذلك كمدرس؟ والآن، كيف\nسأستخدم هذا مع أطفالي؟ ولدي، كما تعلمون،\nلدي بعض الأفكار الرائعة حقًا حول كيفية استخدام هذا\nمع الأطفال، فقط مع، أحب جانب التدريب فيه، وأحب التمايز، ولكن هذا أكثر في جانب خانميجو، وأنا  أعلم أنك\nستصل إلى ذلك معنا، لأنني أحب خانميجو. أنا فقط أقول. - لا، أعني، من الواضح أنني\nمتحيز، أحب خانميجو، لكني أشعر بحماس أكبر تجاهه في كل مرة أتحدث إليك فيها، دكتور بافينغتون. وكما تعلمون، بالنسبة لأولئك الذين يستمعون، فإن العديد من ميزات المعلم هي أفكار مباشرة من الدكتور بوفينجتون. لذا فإن تعليقاتك\nتتجلى بالتأكيد في منتجنا. لكن دعونا ننتقل إلى ذلك، لأن هوبارت كانت بالفعل منطقة منخرطة إلى حد كبير،\nومنخرطة بشدة في الاستخدام، دعنا نسميها أكاديمية خان ما قبل الذكاء الاصطناعي. ثم عرضنا عليكم جميعًا\nالعروض التوضيحية المبكرة لخانميغو، ومنذ شهر مارس، كنتم جميعًا\nمن أولى المناطق في البلاد، وربما في\nالعالم، التي استخدمت خانميغو بطريقة منهجية،\nويبدو أنها بطريقة منتجة. ما هي\nردود أفعالكم الأصلية تجاه خانميغو؟ ما هي الأسئلة أو التطلعات التي\nلا تزال لديك لذلك؟ وكيف كانت التجربة خلال الأشهر القليلة الماضية؟ سأبدأ معك يا دكتور بافينغتون، ثم أذهب إلى دكتور كريج. - حسنًا، أنا أحب جانب\nالثقة في الطالب، أليس كذلك؟ لذا أعني، أي شيء تريد أن تقرأه عن إنجازات الطلاب يجب أن يبدأ ببناء الثقة التي لديهم داخل أنفسهم، وأنهم يعرفون أنهم يستطيعون القيام بذلك. ومن ثم فإن مهمتنا هي التأكد من أننا نزودهم بالمهارات التي يمكنهم من خلالها إظهار أنفسهم والحصول على مستوى الثقة هذا. وأحد الأشياء التي كانت موجودة قبل كوفيد، وبعد ذلك يمكنك الآن\nالانتقال إلى كوفيد، هو أنك بدأت للتو تلاحظ أن الأطفال لا يطرحون أسئلة حقًا. لا يريدون رفع أيديهم. وبعد ذلك، أنت\nالمعلم الذي يحاول السحب، وأنت تطلب،\nوتبتكر خطافات، وتحاول إشراك الأطفال. انه صعب. ومع ذلك، يمكنني الذهاب إلى مدرسة ابتدائية وماذا أشاهد\nالأطفال يفعلون على جهاز Chromebook أو iPad أو أي شيء آخر؟ إنهم يخرجون تلقائيًا\n، ويضربون الميكروفون، \"أرني ثعبانًا أزرق\nوأخبرني لماذا هو أزرق.\" يمين؟ وهم يحبون هذا النوع من الأشياء. ولذا فهم ميالون جدًا\nللتحدث إلى أجهزتهم ويحبون الاستجابة التي يتلقونها، مما يجعلهم\nأكثر حماسًا لطرحها والتعرف عليها بشكل أكثر تحديدًا. لذا فإن أحد الأشياء التي أحبها في مشاهدة هذا مع Khanmigo\nهو ذلك المعلم، ذلك الدليل الموجود على الجانب، والأطفال الذين لا يخافون من\nطرح سؤال على الجهاز. وأعتقد أن هذا أمر عبقري لأنهم سيجلسون ويطرحون\nالأسئلة طوال اليوم. وإذا كان لديهم\nمهمة موجهة، ودعنا نقول فقط إنها كتابة المقال. وكما تعلم يا سال، عندما تحدثت معك لأول مرة، ستغضب من هذا، لكنك كنت تتحدث عن اضطرار ابنك إلى كتابة مقال، أليس كذلك؟ لذا كان لدي خمسة مدرسين فقط\nقاموا بتجريب هذا، ولكنني متحمس جدًا لذلك، وأنا أتحدث إلى الجميع حول هذا الموضوع، أليس كذلك؟ أقول: \"لن تصدق\nما أظهره لنا سال خان.\" وبعد ذلك كانت لدي طالبة\nكنت أشرف عليها في المدرسة الإعدادية، فقالت، \"دكتور بافينغتون، هل\nمواد الذكاء الاصطناعي هذه جاهزة بعد؟\" لأنها بحاجة إلى مدرب الكتابة، أليس كذلك؟ ومن ثم أقول، حسنًا، سأتظاهر بأنني ذكاء اصطناعي مثل خانميجو، وقلت، \"سأكون مدربك في الكتابة.\" وكنت أحاول التظاهر وكأنني أسأل، كنت سأطرح سؤالاً كما أعتقد أن الذكاء الاصطناعي سيفعل، وليس أنني استبدلت\nخانميغو الخاص بك، سال. ولكن هذا ما يمكنني أن أخبرك به.  لقد كتبت مقالة من ستة فقرات\nعن الغموض، وكانت جميلة.  لقد احتاجت إلى تلك المساعدة الإضافية بمجرد طرح الأسئلة\nوالحصول على الإجابات، وتشجيعها قليلاً. وكانت جميلة. ومن بين الأشياء التي أخبرنا بها معلمونا، ما مدى روعة أن يكون لديك معلم\nأو مساعد أو مدرب عندما لا أكون متاحًا؟ وقد أحبوا ذلك\nلأنهم رأوا، وهؤلاء معلمو المدرسة الثانوية\nقالوا، أنا لا أستيقظ في الساعة الثانية صباحًا عندما ينتهون من لعب لعبة Minecraft ويقررون البدء في\nكتابة ورقتهم ويزدهرون، لديهم تعليم  مساعد، ويطرحون الأسئلة\nويأتون إلى المدرسة ويشعرون بالثقة في عملهم. ولذا أعتقد أن هذا\nهو جمال هذا. الآن، سأستمر في\nالعودة كمعلمك والتأكد من أنك قد\nتقدمت بطلبك وأنك تمثل صوتك، وأنك تمثل\nما قمت بتعيينه لك. ولكن واو،\nمستوى الثقة لدى الأطفال مذهل. وهذا ما يعجبني فيه.  في أي وقت يمكنك الحصول على\nمدرس في ذلك الوقت، وأعتقد أن هذا\nهو أفضل جزء من الأمر. أعتقد أن التعليقات التي تمكنا من تقديمها لك، والتي مفادها أنك جعلت البرنامج أفضل، هي سجل الدردشة بأكمله، أليس كذلك؟ لذا أستطيع أن أرى المدة التي استغرقتها مشاركتك، ونوع الأسئلة التي تطرحها، وهي ليست مجرد عملية نسخ ولصق سريعة. أنت حقًا\nتستخدم التمييز والتنقية وطرح الأسئلة الصحيحة لتقديم عمل رائع. أنا أحب هذا عن هذا. طرح الأسئلة، والدروس الخصوصية،\nوبناء الثقة. وهذا كل ما نريده لطلابنا. - كما تعلمون، أسمع\nموضوعين قويين حقًا هناك. الأول هو\nجانب بناء الثقة فيه، والذي يعتبر\nمنطقيًا في العالم عند الاستبطان. إذا استطاع الطلاب أن\nيصبحوا أكثر ثقة ويحصلوا على إجابات لأسئلتهم،\nفسوف يشاركون بشكل أكبر. ثم الأمر الآخر،\nالذي أشرت إليه للتو، وهو العملية التي تتم على المخرجات فقط. وهذا، من المثير للاهتمام، أعتقد أن الذكاء الاصطناعي يعطينا عدسة على العملية\nالتي لم نشهدها من قبل، لأنك لن\nترى ما يفعله الطالب في الثانية صباحًا أثناء\nكتابة مقالته، وهم  ربما يجعلون\nأختهم الكبرى تكتبها لهم\nأو شيء من هذا القبيل. والآن تحصل على عدسة. دكتور كريج، ماذا عن نفسك؟  كما تعلم، ما هو\nرد فعلك الأولي على خانميغو، خاصة فيما يتعلق برد\nفعلك على ChatGPT، وكيف كانت التجربة حتى الآن؟ - هذا سؤال عظيم.  كما تعلم، بصراحة تامة،\nعندما تعلم أنه يمكنك الذهاب إلى جميع\nأنواع ورش العمل المختلفة وقراءة الكتب، كما\nتعلم، يكون ذلك مفيدًا. يمنحك شرارة. لكن، كما تعلمون، يبدو الأمر مثل،\nكيف يمكنني أن آخذ تلك الشرارة وأسمح لتلك الشرارة أن تتخذ مثل الطبيعة العضوية لها، إلى حيث تصبح جزءًا لا يتجزأ من طريقة قيامك بالأشياء، أليس كذلك؟ نتحدث عن الثقافة\nونتحدث عن المناخ. وأرى أشياء مثل، كما\nتعلمون، المساواة والوصول، وكما تعلمون، نتحدث عن\nفقدان التعلم ونتحدث عن كيفية تأثير ماثيو، أليس كذلك؟ من يملكون يستمرون في الحصول\nومن لا يملكون لا يفعلون ذلك. كيف نصل إلى هذه الفجوة ونوفر الفرص حقًا؟ كنت في ورشة عمل\nبالأمس مع زميل، وكنا ننظر إلى\nاختبار SAT الرقمي الجديد، وقالت زميلتي، وهي\nمعلمة ووالدة مشاركة، \"حسنًا، كما تعلمون،\nكنت أعمل مع ابنتي وأنتم  أعلم أنها لم تفهم هذا وذاك والآخر.\" وهكذا، كما تعلم، أقول،\nحسنًا، يمكننا أن نحضر لك مدرسًا، كما تعلم، وداه، داه، داه، داه، داه.  وقد جعلني\nأفكر في هذا الأمر مرة أخرى، لأنه مثل، ماذا عن خانميجو؟ حسنًا، بالنسبة إلى وجهة نظرك،\nوبالنسبة إلى وجهة نظر الدكتور بافينغتون، فقد كنا نسير على \nمسار أكاديمية خان لفترة طويلة الآن.  لقد استخدمتها من وجهة نظر الطالب، ومن وجهة نظر المعلم،\nوالآن، من خلال مناطق خان، من منظور إداري. لكن ما أراه مع خانميغو هو القدرة على أخذ\nالأفكار التي لدى الناس والوصول بها إلى حيث تكون منهجية. ولذا أعتقد أننا كلما ابتعدنا\nأكثر فأكثر عن الذاكرة الروتينية،\nبدأت ترى الخطوط غير واضحة. أعني أن طلابنا\nمبدعون، ومنتجون، وكتاب أغاني، ومغنون، ومذيعون، أليس كذلك؟ إنهم أمناء ومستهلكون للوسائط والمعلومات،\nلكنهم أيضًا يصنعونها. فماذا يتطلب كل ذلك؟ يتطلب الأمر عمقًا متزايدًا\nللمعرفة والتعقيد والتفاعل مع المواد، أليس كذلك؟ التفاعل مع المفاهيم، وما إلى ذلك. حسنًا، المشكلة هي، إذا\nفكرت في تأثير ماثيو، وكما تعلم، في\nقدرة بعض المواقف اجتماعيًا واقتصاديًا وثقافيًا، حيث تكون قادرة على سد الفجوات وتحديدها وتمويلها،\nفماذا عن أي شخص آخر؟ ماذا عن أولئك الذين لا يستطيعون الوصول إلى مثل هذه الأنواع من الأشياء؟ وحتى لو فعلوا ذلك،\nفماذا لو لم ينجح الأمر؟ وهكذا نسمع كل شيء عن لامبالاة الطلاب وعدم\nمشاركتهم، كما تعلمون، مهما كانت الحالة،\nوهذا سؤال سأطرحه. سأقول، حسنًا، دعنا نقول فقط أننا نجذب\nانتباه طلابك. لديك جمهور أسير. ماذا ستفعل به؟ دعونا نقلب السيناريو على ذلك، أليس كذلك؟ ولذلك أعتقد أن الأمر المثير بالنسبة لي هو أننا نستخدم هذا الوضع التجريبي لـKhanmigo، وبينما\nنلاحظه، ترى الطلاب يتفاعلون مع المعرفة والمفاهيم بطريقة تزيد من تعقيد ما يفعلونه  . وهو ليس تفاعلًا، وليس تفاعلًا، أفضل طريقة لوضعه\nهي إجراء معاملة، أليس كذلك؟ الأمر ليس مجرد، حسنًا، أنا\nبحاجة إلى هذا، أعطني ذلك. إنها علاقة مستمرة حيث\nيتفاعل الطلاب مع مواد جديدة، أو يتحدون أنفسهم، أو يوسعون ما\nيعتقدون أنه صحيح. وإعادة قبول التعلم هو ما نحن متحمسون له جميعًا، أليس كذلك؟ لذلك نتحدث هنا كثيرًا، كما تعلمون، كيف يمكننا إيجاد طرق\nللزواج بين المشاعر، والغرض، والإمكانيات، وما إلى ذلك. ولذلك عندما أنظر إلى خانميغو،\nمن وجهة نظر الدكتور بافينغتون، إذا كنت مدرسًا، فهذا لا يعد\nتدريسًا بالنسبة لك، أليس كذلك؟ ولكن ماذا يمكن أن تفعل؟ يمكن أن يساعد في تحديث المعرفة. يمكنه، كما تعلمون، أن ينشئ\nويتشارك مع المعلم لإنشاء خطافات، أليس كذلك؟ يمكن أن يساعد المعلم من خلال\nإنشاء تذاكر خروج معهم. يمكن أن يساعد في تخطيط الدرس. يمكن أن يعطي، كما تعلمون،\nميزة صغيرة رائعة حيث يمكنك أخذ درس كامل وتحويله إلى\nقصيدة صغيرة ممتعة، أليس كذلك؟ يمكنك المشاركة في إنشاء نماذج التقييم،\nوكل هذا النوع من الأشياء، أليس كذلك؟ أهداف التعلم، استخدمها كأداة لتحقيق وجهة نظر الدكتور بافينغتون.  وبعد ذلك، على جانب المتعلم. تفضل. - أعني أن بعض\nالأشياء الأكثر إثارة التي اكتشفوها أثناء الرحلة التجريبية هي\n أنه يمكنك التحدث إلى شخصية أدبية. يا الهي! أو يمكنك التحدث إلى شخص ما\nتاريخيًا وبعد ذلك، تضعه في هذه اللحظة ويجلب التعلم إلى الحياة. وهذا أمر جذاب للغاية.  كما تعلمون، عندما أفكر\nفي التمايز الذي قلناه لسنوات، كما تعلمون، كان ذلك واحدًا من\nأهم الأمور في أكاديمية خان. وكما قلت،\nوكما قال الدكتور كريج، كنا نستخدم أكاديمية خان،\nكنا من أوائل المتبنين. احببته.  لقد كان لدينا قاموسنا الخاص، حتى أننا صنعنا\nقاموس أكاديمية خان الخاص بنا، وكان الأمر مضحكًا جدًا فيما يتعلق بكيفية استخدامه. لكن ما الذي أعجبني في ذلك؟ أحببت أن يكون هناك تمايز. كان هناك ذلك الدليل على\nالجانب، بعض المساعدة الإضافية، أليس كذلك؟ وأنا أرى أن خانميغو كذلك تمامًا، ولكني أرى أيضًا أنه جذاب تمامًا. لذا يمكنني أن أنظر إلى الأمر، واو،\nالتمايز، وباعتباري معلمًا، لم يكن علي\nفعل الكثير لتوفير هذا التمايز. وهو دليل على الجنب. ولكن على نفس المنوال، هذا ليس شيئًا\nلا يريد الأطفال القيام به.  لقد احبوه. الآن، أحد مدرسي اللغة الإنجليزية لدينا، وقد انزعجت تمامًا من هذا، هو أن أحد الأطفال قال، وكان يتفاعل\nمع شخصية تاريخية مع خانميغو، وقال الطفل، \"هذا أكثر متعة من تيك توك.\" إذن يا سال، لقد نجحت. إنها أكثر إفادة من TikTok. وعندما يخبرك الأطفال بذلك، فاعلم أن لديك شيئًا ما هناك. لكن على أية حال، أعتقد أن\nهذه إضافة كبيرة لهذا. هذا ليس المكان الذي يجب أن أقوم فيه\nبمهمتي. إنهم في الواقع موجودون هناك\nويتفاعلون معها، ويأخذونها إلى مستويات جديدة. ووجدنا مع بعض الأطفال الذين كانوا جزءًا من\nالطيار، أنهم كانوا يفعلون أشياء لم تكن جزءًا من مهمتهم. لقد كانوا يبتكرون الأشياء،\nوينشئون مثل الشركات، ويضعون هذه السيناريوهات. لقد كان مجرد هستيري. ولم نطلب منهم أن يفعلوا ذلك.  لقد أحبوا ذلك حقًا. ولذا أعتقد أن هذا\nهو ما نريده للأطفال. نريدهم أن يتساءلوا. نريدهم أن يبتكروا. نريدهم أن يكونوا قادرين على\nحل المشكلات وأن يخرجوا إلى هناك ويأخذوا المعلومات\nويفعلوا شيئًا بها. وهذا ما حدث بالفعل مع هذا. أعتقد، مرة أخرى، أن\nجمال العودة إلى الوراء والنظر إلى\nسجل الدردشة، كمعلم، حتى أعرف ما\nيفعلونه، أستطيع أن أرى السلامة، أستطيع أن أرى عملهم، وما إلى ذلك، هذا مهم حقًا  للمعلمين. لكنني أعتقد أن هذا قد\nفتح معنى مختلفًا تمامًا للمشاركة وما الذي يتساءلون عنه، وما الذي يريدون معرفة المزيد عنه، وماذا يريدون أن يفعلوا به؟ وأجد أن\nالأطفال الذين نخدمهم اليوم، أعتقد أن لديهم\nقلبًا متعاطفًا مع الآخرين، وأنهم قادرون على حل المشكلات. أعتقد أن\nلديهم ريادة الأعمال، كما تعلمون،\nيريدون صنع الأشياء ويريدون أن يكونوا ناجحين في ذلك، ويريدون أن يخدموا\nالآخرين، ويحلوا المشكلات، ويريدون أن يكونوا ناجحين\nفيما يفعلونه.  لقد صنعت. وهذا مجرد\nتغيير في قواعد اللعبة فيما يتعلق بالإنصاف. وأعتقد أن الدكتور كريج\nقال ذلك بشكل جيد. يمكنني أن آخذ متعلمًا للغة الإنجليزية، والذي جربناه مع مدرس اللغة الإنجليزية لدينا، وهو مجرد تغيير لقواعد اللعبة بالنسبة لهم. أعني أن لغتهم الأساسية ليست حجر عثرة بالنسبة لهم. إنهم على قدم المساواة مع زملائهم في الفصل. وهذا رائع جدًا. أحد الأشياء أيضًا، كما تعلمون، هو أننا نتحدث مع مدرس الكيمياء للمستوى المتقدم لدينا، وهو أيضًا مدرس جامعي مبكر ذو رصيد مزدوج، فقط ننظر إلى بعض المعادلات التي كانوا يقومون بها في الكيمياء. وكما تعلم، لم\nيقدم لهم خانميغو الإجابة، لكنه كان يستجوبهم\nحول كيفية الحصول على الإجابة. وهكذا أحب مدرسونا ذلك، كما تعلمون. إذا كنت في المنزل تحاول\nحل هذه المشكلة ولم يتمكنوا من مساعدتك، فإن خانميغو\nكان موجودًا لمساعدتهم. الآن، سأخبركم\nأنهم جميعًا قالوا إن الأطفال في بعض الأحيان بدأوا في التنمر على الذكاء الاصطناعي لأنهم أرادوا الإجابة فقط ولم تكن\nلتفعل ذلك. وهذا ما جعل المعلمين سعداء جدًا. فقط لإعلامك، هناك\nبعض التعليقات لك. كان هناك القليل من التنمر الذي\nيحدث في بعض الأحيان مع خانميجو، وكما تعلم،\nاستمر في حثهم وقال، لن أعطيك الإجابة. - نعم، علينا أن نعلم-\n- لقد أحببنا هذا الجزء منه. - أعتقد أن\nالقاعدة الذهبية يجب أن تنطبق على الذكاء الاصطناعي. تعامل مع الذكاء الاصطناعي كما تريد أن\nتعامل نفسك. أعني، مجرد الاستمرار\nفي عدسة ردود الفعل تلك.  ولم أكن أمزح عندما،\nكما تعلمون، في اجتماعنا الأخير، كان لدينا العديد من الميزات حول خانميغو التي خرجت مباشرة من ذلك الاجتماع. لذلك سأستمر\nفي اختيار عقولكم.  كما تعلمون، بعض الأشياء\nالتي نعمل عليها تتجاوز ما\nتختبرونه بالفعل. نحن نعمل على منح\nالذكاء الاصطناعي، وإعطاء خانميغو إحساسًا بالذاكرة، حتى يعرف النغمة التي يفضلها المعلم أو الطالب. فهو يتذكر المحادثات السابقة، ويمكنه المتابعة من حيث توقفت. نحن نضيف أشياء\nيمكن للمدرسين من خلالها تعيين \nأنشطة أكاديمية خان التقليدية وأنشطة الذكاء الاصطناعي من خلال خانميغو. وربما قم بضبط\nالنشاط، بدلاً من قول \"تحدث إلى الشخصيات التاريخية\". مثل، \"مرحبًا، أريدك أن\nتتحدث إلى بنجامين فرانكلين وتكتشف ما يلي.\" ولذا فإننا سوف\nنفعل أشياء من هذا القبيل. لدينا بالفعل القليل من هذا، ولكن سيكون لدينا المزيد في التقارير، حيث يعمل خانميجو\nكمساعد تدريس حقًا.  لقد ذكرت متعلمي اللغة الإنجليزية.  لقد أصدرنا للتو أنه\nيعمل الآن بكل اللغات الرئيسية. ولذا يمكن للطالب أن يقوم بإجراء الرياضيات أو الكيمياء باللغة الإنجليزية، ولكن يمكنه الحصول على\nمساعدتهم أو دروسهم باللغة الإسبانية أو البرتغالية أو الهندية أو أي لغة قد يحتاجون إليها. والشيء الآخر\nالذي نأمل أن نفعله، دعنا نسميه في\nالأشهر الستة المقبلة، هو أن يكون لدينا الذكاء الاصطناعي، وأن يكون لدينا أنشطة متعددة المستخدمين، وتسهيل\nالتعلم التعاوني بين العديد من الطلاب. لذا، كما تعلمون، يمكنكم أن تتخيلوا،\nبدلًا من إجراء مناظرة مع الذكاء الاصطناعي، ربما يمكن للذكاء الاصطناعي\nتسهيل المناظرة مع العديد من الطلاب. أو قم بإجراء حوار سقراطي\nمع عدة طلاب أو قم بإجراء محاكاة أو\nلعبة مع العديد من الطلاب. لذا، أود أن تكون\nأفكاركم، كما تعلمون، هي ما هو موجود بالفعل في تلك\nالقائمة التي تحدثت إليكم عنها للتو، وربما تكونون متحمسين لها للغاية. أي أفكار حول كيفية تعديله؟  هل هناك أي مخاوف، وفيما يتعلق بالمخاطرة، ما الذي تود أن ترى المزيد منه؟ هل هناك، هل\nرأيت مشاكل تريد\nالتأكد من أنه يمكننا معالجتها لجعل الأمور تسير بشكل أكثر سلاسة؟ سأبدأ معك يا دكتور بافينغتون. - حسنًا، أعتقد أن أحد\nالأشياء التي قدمنا ​​تعليقات بشأنها، هو أنه في بعض الأحيان نلتقط أشياء تمثل مخاوف تتعلق بالسلامة بالنسبة لنا. وأعتقد أنك تناولت، كما تعلمون، على الفور بدأت في البحث، كيف يمكننا التأكد من أنه إذا كان هناك نوع من المخاطر على الطالب أو الأشخاص الآخرين بما نحن عليه، فهناك نظام مؤشر. ولذا فإننا نقدر بشدة\nأنك تلقيت هذه التعليقات، لأنه في كثير من الأوقات نكون قادرين على التقاط ذلك في الفصل أو في بعض الأعمال أو مجموعة من العمل، أو إذا كان الطالب يتحدث إلى طالب آخر أو معلم  ، نحن قادرون على التقاط بعض العلامات للأشياء التي قد يحتاج فيها الطالب إلى مساعدة إضافية، لأنه يمر\nبوقت سيء للغاية. أو أن هناك فقط بعض\nالإمكانية لتطبيق خاطئ أو\nشيء من هذا القبيل. ولذا أعتقد أنك أخذت\nتعليقاتنا جيدًا فيما يتعلق باهتمامنا بالأطفال الذين قد يحتاجون إلى بعض\nالدعم العاطفي الاجتماعي الإضافي، أو إذا كانت سلامتهم معرضة\nللخطر في منازلهم أو مع أشخاص آخرين. أعتقد أن هذا كان\nأحد أكبر مخاوفنا عندما بدأنا البرنامج التجريبي لأول مرة. لأن لدينا أشياء\nكهذه في الوقت الحالي، وأرى أطفالًا يستخدمون\nخانميجو أكثر مما أعني، أعتقد أنهم سيستخدمونه كثيرًا.  ولذا، إذا كانوا سيستخدمون ذلك كثيرًا، فأنا أحب أنك قمت بوضع\nبعض إجراءات السلامة. وكان ذلك مهمًا حقًا بالنسبة لنا. فيما يتعلق بالمضي قدمًا، أعتقد أن المشاركة والتواصل مع الآخرين أمر مهم حقًا. أشكركم جزيل الشكر على الجزء اللغوي الذي قمت بإنشائه للتو، لأنني أعتقد أن هذا\nمهم للغاية الآن. وأود فقط أن أقول، أحد الأشياء التي\nأعتقد أنها مهمة حقًا، وأعتقد أن هذا يعود\nإلى السؤال القديم، ونحن حقًا نحصل عليه\nمن أطفال المدارس المتوسطة أكثر من أي شخص آخر، مثل، لماذا\nيجب أن أتعلم  الذي - التي؟ وأعتقد أن وجود خبراء\nفي هذا المجال، إذا استطعنا، إلى جانب كون جزء الذكاء الاصطناعي هو ذلك الخبير، عندما تقول أنه يمكنهم التواصل مع الطلاب الآخرين، أود أن أرى قاعدة بيانات،\nأو إلى جانب خبير الذكاء الاصطناعي، أود أن أرى\nالخبراء في هذا المجال. لأنه في كثير من الأوقات مع\nالاستعداد الجامعي والمهني والتفكير في هذه الأمور\nسيكونون قادتنا التاليين، كما تعلمون، يتحدثون إلى\nالناس ويفهمون ما يفعلونه من أجل لقمة العيش\nوكيف يمكن أن يتغير، ومفهوم الذكاء الاصطناعي بأكمله  . اسمحوا لي أن أعطي نقطة نهاية الحالة. لذا الآن، عندما تفكر\nفي علوم الكمبيوتر، ونحن نتحدث عن البرمجة ونحاول فقط حث\nالأطفال على دراسة البرمجة وعلوم الكمبيوتر، سيكون الأمر\nمختلفًا الآن. يمنح الذكاء الاصطناعي نكهة مختلفة تمامًا، وأعتقد أنهم\nبحاجة إلى التحدث إلى جانب خبراء الذكاء الاصطناعي، من هم هؤلاء الأشخاص الموجودون في الميدان؟ مثل شعبك. مثل كيف يعمل هذا خلف الكواليس؟ وماذا، وتريد أن\nتفعل هذا من أجل لقمة العيش؟ وإذا كنت تستمتع بها حقًا،\nفهي في الحقيقة ليست حتى وظيفة. لكنني أعتقد أنه\nيجب أن يكون هناك المزيد من ذلك. وهكذا، كما تعلمون، هناك\nبرامج يمكنك من خلالها مقابلة\nخبير هنا، أو خبير هناك. ولكن إعطاء الأطفال نكهة حقيقية لذلك. وبعد ذلك، أعني، لا يزال بإمكانك، إذا كنت ستسمح\nلهم بالالتقاء بأطفال آخرين، أود أن أراهم\nيجتمعون مع خبراء آخرين في هذا المجال. - إنها فكرة رائعة. أعتقد أنكم تعلمون جميعًا أن لدينا\nمؤسسة غير ربحية أخرى بدأتها أثناء\nالوباء تسمى schoolhouse.world، والتي، والمقدمة الكاملة\nلـschoolhouse.world، كما تعلمون، هي ربط\nالعالم من خلال التعلم ومنح الأشخاص دروسًا خصوصية مباشرة مجانية\nعبر  مؤتمر عبر الفيديو. والطريقة التي نقوم بها بذلك هي\nمن خلال الاستفادة من المتطوعين. العديد من المتطوعين هم\nطلاب المدارس الثانوية أو الجامعات، ولكن العديد منهم محترفون. وعندما أطلقنا\nخانميغو بدأنا نفكر، ربما\nيكون خانميغو جسرًا مثيرًا للاهتمام بين أكاديمية خان التقليدية وربما شيئًا\nمثل schoolhouse.world، حيث\nيظهر أشخاص حقيقيون بالفعل. وهكذا يا بيجي، فكرتك\nتقريبًا أفكر فيها، ماذا لو كان موقع schoolhouse.world،\nأعتقد أن معظم المهنيين سيحبون رد الجميل بطريقة ما. إنهم يحبون أن يخبروا،\nكما تعلمون، معظم الآباء، عندما يعودون إلى المنزل، يريدون إخبار أطفالهم عن وظائفهم وأطفالهم غير مهتمين. ولكن قد يكون الأطفال مهتمين\nبوظائف الآباء الآخرين، وهو ما يحدث عادة. ولذلك قد تكون هناك طريقة ممتعة يمكنك من خلالها الظهور في\nهذه الأماكن، في مدرسة على سبيل المثال، ومن ثم يستطيع خانميغو أن يقول، مهلاً، كنت تتساءل عن سبب أهمية هذا. هناك جلسة تحدث. يوضح فلان وفلان\nمن هو باحث الذكاء الاصطناعي، أو من هو الطبيب، أو من هو\nالمحامي، ومن يمكنه التحدث عنه، لماذا لا تذهب إلى ذلك، وسوف\nتتعلم الكثير عن سبب وجود هذا الجبر  مفيد. لذلك أنا أحب هذه الفكرة. دكتور كريج، المزيد من الأفكار،\nاستمر في طرحها، لا يمكننا- - نعم، لا، أنا-\n- والمخاوف والمخاطر، لأن هذه أيضًا\nأفكار، كما تعلم، فرص لنا لجعلها أفضل. - لذا، بصراحة تامة، لكي\nأبتعد عن تلك الملاحظة، أتذكر عندما كنت طالبًا، لم أفهم لماذا\nشكسبير، على سبيل المثال. وكما تعلمون، في الكلية،\nعندما كنت طالبًا جامعيًا ثم خريجًا وما إلى ذلك، بدأت أشعر\nبتقدير مختلف لذلك. لكن من المفارقات، بالنسبة لنقطة الدكتور بافينغتون، ما بدأ ذلك حقًا\nكان هذا الفيديو القصير الذي عثرت عليه، حيث كان هناك ممثلون وممثلات يتحدثون عن سبب شكسبير. ولأول مرة\nبدأت أنظر إلى المسرح، على سبيل المثال، ليس فقط في\nواقعه المنعزل، مثل، أوه، هذا هو المسرح،\nولكن كجسر، إذا صح التعبير، كما ذكرت، لجميع\nأنواع المهن الأخرى  . وعندما ترى وتسمع كيف أصبحت الأشياء هجينة الآن، صحيح، لم تعد الأشياء منعزلة بعد الآن،\nيمكنك أن تكون في موضوع ما وتطبق المفاهيم\nوالمبادئ والتجارب، ليس فقط على الأشياء الأخرى\nالتي تفعلها  حاليًا، لكن الاحتمالات لا حصر لها لأننا حقًا لا نعرف كيف سيحدث ذلك\nلاحقًا، أليس كذلك؟ نحن لا\nندرك ذلك دائمًا بوعي. ولذلك عندما أفكر في\nالأنشطة الحالية للطلاب داخل خانميغو، أود أن أشجعكم على\nمواصلة البحث عن طرق لكسر العزلة. وأعني بذلك، كما تعلمون،\nأنها مثل طرق الكتابة.  لقد تم تدريس أساليب الكتابة لفترة\nطويلة جدًا بطريقة فريدة. إذًا، هذه كتابة تفسيرية، وهذه كتابة جدلية،\nوهذه كتابة سردية. لكن، كما تعلمون، تظهر الأبحاث\nأن عملية الكتابة لدى مؤلفينا الأكثر نجاحًا، تعكس تلك الخاصة بالأطفال الصغار قبل المرور\nبنظام التعليم التقليدي من الروضة إلى الصف الثاني عشر، بسبب ما\nتحدثنا عنه من قبل بالضبط. فضول.  هل هو الانضباط؟ بالتأكيد. اقرأ ستيفن كينج عن الكتابة، سيخبرك أنها\nنظام، إنها علم، ولكن يجب أن يكون هناك هذا الشغف. ولذلك بالنسبة لي، أفكر في\nالفرق بين ما قمنا به، وما نقوم به، وما يمكننا وما ينبغي علينا فعله. ما يتعين علينا أن نبدأ في القيام به، والذي\nيمكننا القيام به وينبغي علينا القيام به، هو كسر الجدران بين الفصول الدراسية، وكسر الجدران بين\nالمدرسة وخارجها. يمكن للدكتور بوفينجتون أن يخبرك أن أكثر\nالأشياء نجاحًا التي تحدث الآن كانت عضوية، وبعد\nذلك أصبحت منهجية، حيث\nيتعاون مدرس الهندسة مع مدرس الأعمال، الذي يتعاون مع\nالمعلم في PLTW biomed. لماذا، لأنهم منحازون إلى الأهواء. إنها تتماشى مع الأشياء التي\nتهتم بها. لذلك إذا نظرت إلى شيء\nمثل صياغة قصة، وفهم متى تخرج وتقرأ وتستمع إلى البث الصوتي، فإن جزءًا من الجدال\nهو رواية القصص، أليس كذلك؟ لا يوجد شيء اسمه، أوه،\nهذه كتابة تفسيرية، لذا فأنا أعرض المعلومات فقط، أليس كذلك؟ الكتابة فوضوية. عملية الكتابة غير خطية. كل شيء يتطور ويتغير. لذا، بالنسبة لنقطة الدكتور بافينغتون\n، هناك شيئان هنا. أولاً، تطبيق هذه المواضيع بطريقة تجعلها أكثر سلاسة، ولهذا السبب أحب تعليقك، سال، حول جعل الرحلة شيئًا يبني على نفسه. وإذا كانت قدرة الذكاء الاصطناعي على المستوى الذي يسمح بمواصلة\nتقدم التعلم، فهذا سيغير قواعد اللعبة. كان لدي واحدة من أفضل\nمعلمي التأليف في مدرسة الدراسات العليا، تحدثت عن كيفية تقييم الكتابة في نهاية المطاف\n، وليس عند هؤلاء الصغار، كما تعلمون، حسنًا، لقد\nالتحقت بهذا الفصل وحصلت على درجة A أو ذلك الفصل و  حصل على درجة B. وينبغي أن يكون من أين\nبدأ الطلاب، ومن ثم أين انتهى بهم الأمر في النهاية الطبيعية للجزء. ويتعلق الأمر بهذا النمو. حسنًا، هذا النمو هو ما يجعلك\nتبدأ في فهم، أوه، كل شيء بلاغي، أليس كذلك؟ نعود إلى أفلاطون، كما\nتعلمون، إلى سقراط، إلى أرسطو، مهما كانت الحالة،\nكل شيء بلاغي. حسنًا، طلابنا الآن\nيقدمون عرضًا لعالم ضخم، ولكن\nمن الممكن أيضًا أن يكون متخصصًا، أليس كذلك؟ كيف يمكننا أن نأخذ هذه الأشياء التي يتعلمونها عن\nالتاريخ، وعن التكنولوجيا، وعن الهندسة، وعن\nجسم الإنسان، وكل هذه الأشياء المختلفة ونقول، يمكن أن ينطبق هذا على مجالات\nغير موجودة أصلاً. قد ينتهي الأمر بهذا إلى التطبيق،\nويمكن أن يكون لزجًا، أليس كذلك؟ هذه هي الطريقة التي تعمل بها أدمغتنا. نحن بحاجة إلى لصق المعلومات على الأشياء التي لدينا بالفعل أطر مبنية عليها، بطريقة تجعلني الآن أجمع بين شيء أفعله في الفصل\nمع النشاط الجانبي الذي أملكه، كما تعلمون، متجرًا أقوم به\nجانبيًا  أو أيًا كان، وأيضًا في المنزل وفي تفضيلاتي\nالشخصية، كما تعلمون، ومهما كانت الحالة. لذلك، على سبيل المثال، إذا استمعت\nإلى ملفات صوتية حول أشياء متعلقة بالرياضة،\nفقد يغير ذلك الطريقة التي أقوم بها\nبجلسة مسجلة للموظفين، لأنني أحب الطريقة\nالتي يقدمون بها هذا أو ذاك  ، كما تعلمون، استخدم نبرة الصوت هناك وما إلى ذلك. لذا فإن تشجيعي سيكون ذو شقين. أولاً، استمر في كسر\nهذه الصوامع لإظهار كيف تتناسب كل هذه الأشياء\nمع أشياء أخرى، أليس كذلك؟ وبعد ذلك، هناك\nالقليل الآن في خانميغو، حيث يتعلق الأمر\nبالتنقل بين عمليات القبول في الكليات والمساعدات المالية، كما تعلمون، ثم أيضًا مثل الجانب الوظيفي. لذلك أود أن أقول، أود أن\nأشجعكم على الاستمرار في ربط الطلاب\nوما يتعلمونه أو يمكن أن يتعلموا عنه، وماذا بعد ذلك. وعندما تفكر في\nولاية إنديانا، على سبيل المثال، فإن الكثير مما نفعله\nأنا والدكتور بافينغتون وفريقنا هنا يساعد في مواءمة\nما يفعله الطلاب الآن مع أوراق اعتماد العملة القابلة للتكديس، وإظهار أصحاب العمل المستقبليين،\nولجان المنح الدراسية،  وما إلى ذلك، أن أتقن شيئًا ما\nأو أتقن شيئًا ما أو أمتلك خبرة في شيء ما. ونحن نرى هذا حتى مع الشارات الرقمية والأشياء من هذا القبيل. لذلك عندما يرى الطالب مسارًا وظيفيًا، يكون الأمر مخيفًا لأن\nاللغة المستخدمة لوصفه قد\nلا يكون لها أي علاقة بما تنطوي عليه المهنة حقًا. أو المهن المستقبلية التي\nقد أستخدم هذه الأشياء فيها غير موجودة، أليس كذلك؟ فكيف يمكننا أن نحاول\nالمزاوجة بين تلك العوالم لربط الطلاب\nالحاضرين بمستقبلهم على المدى القصير، بالإضافة إلى الفرص\nالموجودة هناك بعد ذلك والتي لا نعرف عنها حتى الآن. - أحب هذا النوع من المواضيع التي تهدف إلى كسر الحواجز بين المواضيع، والتي أعتقد أنها أصبحت الآن\nقابلة للتنفيذ أكثر من أي وقت مضى. ثم أيضًا بين\nالمدرسة والعالم الحقيقي. سؤال أخير لك دكتور بافينغتون. دعونا نتقدم بسرعة، لا\nأعلم، سنتين، ثلاث سنوات. ليس من الضروري أن يمر وقت طويل، لكن الأمور تتغير بسرعة كبيرة. هل تعتقد أن كل ما\nتحدثنا عنه سوف\nيغير شكل المدرسة بشكل جذري، بما في ذلك، كما تعلمون، لم نتحدث حتى عن\nأشياء مثل التقييم، والتي بدأنا في\nالتفكير فيها من جانبنا. أو هل تعتقد أنه سيكون مجرد\nملحق لطيف فوق البنية الحالية؟ أو هل تعتقد أنه في بعض النواحي يغير الفصل الدراسي\nبشكل أساسي يا دكتور بافينغتون؟ - حسنًا، أعني أن تيم\nسيعرف هذا يا دكتور كريج. أعني، كانت لدي فلسفة مفادها\nأنه خلال فترة كوفيد-19، \nتغير المشهد إلى الأبد، أليس كذلك؟ أعني أنه تغير بالفعل. إذا لم أرغب في الحضور\nإلى مؤسستي العامة والجلوس طوال اليوم، فيمكنني اختيار\nالذهاب إلى مدرسة عبر الإنترنت، وكما تعلمون، ربما يكون هذا مناسبًا لي. أعتقد أنه عندما أنظر إلى هذا، لا أريد أن أعتبره تكميليًا. أريد أن أنظر إلى هذا كأداة، كما\n تعلمون، قابلة للاستخدام الآن، ولكنها أيضًا قادرة على\nمساعدتنا في المستقبل.  كما تعلمون، عندما أفكر في الأشياء وأفكر في\nالاستعداد الوظيفي الجامعي، وكما تعلمون، الآن يمكنني السماح لطفل بالخروج\nمبكرًا، والتخرج مبكرًا، وكما تعلمون، لدي\nأطفال يتخرجون بدرجة الزمالة في\nمدرستنا الثانوية الآن. ما الذي أرى احتمال حدوثه هنا؟ أرى ما يريده الناس من الأطفال الذين يتخرجون من المدرسة الثانوية الآن. يريدون منهم أن يكونوا حلالين للمشاكل. يريدون منهم أن يكونوا قادرين على\nالتعاون والعمل ضمن فريق. إنهم يريدون أن يكون لديهم\nممارسات أخلاقية وراءهم. وأعتقد أن لديك بالفعل\nالإمكانية في هذا الشأن. الشيء المثير للاهتمام الآن هو كيف يمكنني منح الطالب تدريبًا داخليًا، وربما يوجد في خانميجو\nجانب تدريبي لهذا الأمر ويكون مهمًا ليومهم.  كما تعلمون، أنا كل ما أهتم به هو\nإعادة اختراع المدرسة الثانوية وكيف تبدو. وكما تعلمون، أعتقد أن\nهذا يمتد إلى المدرسة المتوسطة والابتدائية. أعتقد أن هناك العديد من\nالجوانب المختلفة لهذا الذكاء الاصطناعي التي يمكنني استكشافها.  كما تعلمون، عندما أفكر\nفي أن الأطفال يريدون الاستمتاع، ولا يريدون الخوف من المهام، أرى بالفعل أن هذا الجزء قد تم علاجه. أرى أطفالًا يذهبون إلى هناك\nفقط لأنهم يريدون ذلك، ويحبون طرح الأسئلة. وهذا ما نريده كمعلمين. نريدهم أن يطرحوا الأسئلة وهم مفتونون به. ولذلك أريد أن آخذ هذا\nالسحر وأبني عليه. وإذا كان ذلك يعني إعادة تصميم\nالطريقة التي نؤدي بها المدرسة، فعلينا أن نفعل ذلك، أليس كذلك؟ ولذا، فقد قمنا بالفعل بإعادة تصميم وتجديد مدارسنا الثانوية\nمع مرحلة الدراسة الجامعية المبكرة، وكما تعلمون، يمكنك الحصول على\nشهادات صناعية بعد عام واحد من الدراسة الجامعية وسنتين من الدراسة الجامعية. لا تحتاج بالضرورة إلى\nالذهاب خمسة أيام في الأسبوع. ربما لا تحتاج إلى الذهاب ليوم كامل. لأنه يمكن أن يكون لديك\nفرصة مختلفة. وإذا قدمت هذه الفرصة\nبهذه الطريقة، فستكون مؤهلاً للتخرج وربما حتى الالتحاق بسوق العمل أو الالتحاق بالمرحلة ما بعد الثانوية لاستكشاف ما نحاول\nتحقيقه من خلال، كما تعلمون، بعض مؤهلات ما بعد الثانوية التي تساهم  إلى العالم. لذا فإن كل ما أفكر فيه هو،\nهل هناك طرق أفضل، طرق أكثر كفاءة أو\nطرق أكثر إثارة وجذابة لإعادة اختراع الأشياء التي نقوم بها؟ وأعتقد أنه مثل أي شيء\nجديد في التعليم، أحيانًا نكون آخر المتبنين. فلماذا؟ وأعتقد أننا بدأنا الحديث عن هذا. إنهم خائفون من ذلك. ولا يمكنك أن تخاف منه، عليك أن تتقبل ما هو المستقبل. ولذا أعتقد أنه\nسيكون هناك بعض القدرة على التكيف عندما تتحدث عن\nالمكملات، أليس كذلك؟ أعني، الآن، سيكون\nلديك مستخدمون مبكرون سيأخذون شيئًا موجودًا لديهم في\nخريطة مناهجهم الدراسية ويقولون، \"كيف يساعدني الذكاء الاصطناعي؟\" \"كيف يمكنني استخدام خانميغو؟\" ومن ثم ستبدأ في\nرؤية بعض الابتكارات حيث سيكون الأمر مثل، أنا\nلست كذلك، إنه ليس بديلاً. وسوف ترونهم\nيبدأون في استخدامه بطريقة تعزز أكثر، ولن تحل محل ما فعلوه. وهو يدفع الأطفال\nإلى النمو والتعلم وربما يتوصلون إلى فكرة\nأنهم قد يعالجون شيئًا ما.  كما تعلمون، أنا أحب حقيقة\nأن هذا الجيل يحب حل المشكلات. وسوف يقولون مثل، \"ماذا عن هذا؟\" أو \"ماذا عن ذلك؟\" وأعتقد أن هذا لديه\nالقدرة على القيام بذلك. لذا، إذا كان لدي طالب، كما تعلمون، للحديث عما كنا نتحدث عنه، فسنضع الأطفال في فصل الطب الحيوي ومن ثم سنجعلهم يتفاعلون مع برنامج الهندسة، لأنهم يفكرون في شيء واحد و  هؤلاء هم الأشخاص الموجودون هنا الذين يمكنهم حقًا إنشاء هذا النظام لك أو مساعدتك في\nحساباتك أو أي شيء آخر.  تم كسر تلك الحواجز. وأرى أن المدرسة الثانوية\nيتم إعادة اختراعها بالكامل من خلال منح الأطفال\nالفرصة لتطبيق ذلك في بيئة واقعية. ولذلك أعتقد أن هناك مجالًا لذلك، وسأعطيكم\nفكرة هنا، كما تعلمون، أن ولاية إنديانا تفعل شيئًا ما من خلال\nحسابات المنح الدراسية المهنية. يطلق عليهم CSA.  والمقصود منه حقًا هو إدخال\nالأطفال إلى القوى العاملة، والتعلم والتدريب المبني على العمل. وهم بالفعل على أعتاب كيف ستبدو شهادة الدراسة الثانوية مع طفل نمنحه CSA؟ وهل هو حقًا تقليدي، حيث يجب أن يكون لديك 40 ساعة معتمدة\nمن هذا وذاك وذاك. وقد بدأوا يرون، حسنًا، ربما لا يحتاجون إلى ذلك. وربما، ربما\nسيكونون شخصًا أضعه في القوى العاملة ولديه بعض المعرفة\nفي استخدام التكنولوجيا بطريقة مناسبة، ويتوصلون إلى حل لشيء كانوا يكافحون من أجل العثور عليه. أعتقد أن الإمكانية موجودة لذلك. أعتقد أنك سترى\nالمتبنين الأوائل يكملون ويستبدلون ثم يجدون أشياء جديدة. وبعد ذلك أعتقد أنك\nسوف ترى الأطفال يقولون، أستطيع أن أفعل هذا، أستطيع أن أفعل ذلك. وسيتعين علينا إعادة النظر\nفي الطريقة التي نقدم بها للسماح بالنمو، إذا كان ذلك منطقيًا. - يجعل الكثير من المعنى. وكما تعلمون، يمكنني التحدث\nمعكم جميعًا لساعات، خاصة حول هذا الموضوع، لأنه\nرائع جدًا. لكنني أحب هذا النوع من\nالدفعة الأخيرة حيث، كما تعلمون، نكسر كل الحدود وفي الواقع نحن دائمًا نستمد أفكارنا منك، أفكار الأنشطة منك، دكتور بوفينجتون.  وقد عززت نوعًا ما شيئًا كنا نفكر فيه، وهو، ماذا لو كان هناك\nنشاط للطلاب، أو للمدرسين، أو لأي شخص، لحل المشكلات الكبيرة في العالم.  كما تعلمون، أنتم بحاجة إلينا،\nوتحتاجون إلى معالجة المناخ، وتريدون معرفة\nكيف يمكنني، كطالب، البدء في معالجة تغير المناخ؟ كيف يمكنني كطالب أن\nأبدأ في معالجة أبحاث السرطان؟ كيف يمكنني، كطالب، أن أبدأ\nفي معالجة أي مشكلة في العالم\nتعتقد أنها بحاجة إلى حل، لا أعرف. يرغب الكثير من الطلاب في ذلك، لكنهم لا يعرفون من أين\nيبدأون، ومن أين يبدأون، لذلك أحب هذه الفكرة أيضًا. حسنًا، شكرًا لكما- - ويمكن لسال، سال أن\nأذكر فقط ما قلته للتو\nومدى أهميته، وهم يحاولون حل الأمور\nالتي تهمهم جدًا. لذا، أثناء تفشي فيروس كورونا،\nكان أحد طلابي يحاول معرفة كيفية الحصول على\nنظام أفضل لتسجيل الوصول مع ظهور الأعراض في غرفة الطوارئ. - همم.\n- و لماذا.  لقد أرادت أن تخبرهم أنه يتعين عليك إعادة ترتيب أولويات\nالأشخاص الموجودين في غرفة الطوارئ الخاصة بك، لأن جدها توفي بسبب فيروس كورونا. لذلك كان لدي رائد\nالأعمال الصغير المبتكر، ولدينا مساحات للصانعين\nهنا، كما تعلمون، نقوم بتنظيم معارض للصناع، ولدينا، ولدينا مساحات للعلوم والتكنولوجيا والهندسة والرياضيات في كل مكان. وكان ابتكارها، وعملت مع\nالمهندسين في المستشفى على الأعراض ومكان وجودها، وكيف نعطي الأولوية لمن\nستراه أولاً، لأنه كان حقيقيًا لها، ولك.  كما تعلمون، عندما\nتقول تغير المناخ، فإن الأشياء التي تهمهم حقًا، سوف يقضونها طوال اليوم. هذا هو نوع الطلاب\nالذي لا يذهب إلى الفراش لأنهم هناك\nيحاولون معرفة أين توجد المعلومات،\nأي نوع من الأدوات، أي نوع من الأدوات. إنها في فصل الطب الحيوي، وتنتقل إلى فصل الهندسة ويقومون بإنشاء جهاز محمول، وسوف يتزامن\nمع الساعات أو أي شيء آخر في المستشفى، لتغيير\nالأولوية مثل، من الذي تريد رؤيته الآن؟ وأعتقد أن أطفالنا\nلديهم هذه الإمكانية، أليس كذلك؟ لذا، خمن ماذا،\nلم يحدث هذا في فصلها الدراسي، بل حدث خارج فصلها الدراسي، لكنها جلبت إلى الفصل الدراسي أنه لا بد من وجود طريقة أفضل. يمين؟ ولذا أعتقد أن هذا\nيفتح جميع أنواع الأسئلة أو المشكلات\nالتي يريدون حلها، ويمنحهم بداية جيدة وسيجعلهم يرغبون\nفي الاستمرار في السعي لتحقيق ذلك. أنت تعرف ما أعنيه؟ وأعتقد أن هذا هو جمال ذلك. إنه أمر ممتع للغاية، فهم لا يريدون التوقف - 100%. لا يمكن أن نتفق أكثر.\n- سال، إذا جاز لي. فقط بالنيابة عنا، كما\nتعلمون، شكرًا لكم على، كما تعلمون، أن هذا ما فعلتموه، أليس كذلك؟ لقد بدأت بتحديد\nمشكلة، حاجة، كانت شخصية بالنسبة\nلك بالمعنى العائلي.  لقد طرحت الكثير من\nالأسئلة وكنت رائدًا، وبعد ذلك، كما تعلم، ها نحن هنا، أليس كذلك؟ ولذا فإن ما نأمله هو أنه بقدر شغفنا نحن الثلاثة،\nعلى سبيل المثال، بالتعليم، كما تعلمون، خانميجو، وبطرق مختلفة فقط لمحاولة\nمساعدة طلابنا، كما تعلمون، على أن يكونوا في مهمة، ليكونوا قادرين  لمتابعة أهوائهم. إذا كان لديهم نفس النوع من الشغف تجاه الأشياء التي يهتمون بها، وقمنا بتزويج الإمكانيات التي يمكنهم من خلالها متابعتها، إذن، كما تعلمون، قد يبدو التعليم مختلفًا،\nولكن الأساسي، كما تعلمون، يظل نجم الشمال الحقيقي كما هو. يمين؟ - 100%.\n- وبعد ذلك، نقوم بالأمر\nبطرق مختلفة، كما تعلم. ولكن لماذا لا يزال هناك. القاسم لا يزال هناك. وهؤلاء أطفالنا، وهذا طلابنا. ولذا أعتقد أنني أشكركم بالنيابة عنا\nعلى دعمكم لذلك. - لا، حسنًا، شكرًا لكم جميعًا\nعلى كونكم جزءًا من هذا. - أوه، مهلا-\n- لأخذ الوقت المستقطع. - هذا.\n- أوه نعم. - كان هذا أفضل شيء على الإطلاق. أعني، أنا لا أمزح معك. يمكنني الجلوس والتحدث مع\nالمعلمين والأطفال الذين كانوا يستخدمون هذا.  كان بإمكاني الجلوس معهم طوال اليوم، وكانوا يرسلون لي\nالأشياء التي كانوا يصنعونها من خانميغو، وكنت أحبها ولدي عمل آخر للقيام به، لكنني أردت أن أقرأ ما\nكانوا يفعلونه بها. وأعتقد، كما تعلمون، مجرد مجد، وشكرا\nلإدراجنا في البرنامج التجريبي. أعتقد أننا سنكون\nروادًا في الخروج والتحدث مع الناس حول كيفية كسر الحواجز\nوكيفية استخدامها. ولكن لا يمكنك القيام بذلك\nدون إعطاء الناس بداية أولية. يمين؟ وقد فعلت ذلك،\nوأنا أقول لك فقط، إنه أمر رائع الجلوس\nوالتحدث مع هؤلاء المعلمين حول الطريقة التي يعتقدون أنهم سيستخدمونها بعد ذلك. وشكرا لكم على ذلك.  لقد أخذت شيئًا أعتقد أنهم كانوا خائفين جدًا منه، وخاصة مدرسي اللغة الإنجليزية. وهم لا يخافون منه. ولذا فهم يعرفون كيف\nسيتعاملون معها.  لقد تحدثوا بالفعل مع وزيرة\nالتعليم لدينا، كاتي جينر، وهو أمر مثير للاهتمام لأنك\nتحدثت إلى كاتي جينر وقالت: \"مرحبًا، أريد\nالتحدث إلى هؤلاء المعلمين.\" وهكذا قمنا بصياغتها\nوكانت مفتونة بها أيضًا.  لقد أخذت شيئًا ما\nوأعطتنا أداة جيدة حقًا لاستخدامها في التعليم. ولهذا، نحن ممتنون لذلك، ولا أستطيع الانتظار لرؤية الإصدار التالي. - لا، نحن متحمسون،\nوأعتقد أن هذا سيكون أحد المحادثات العديدة التي ستجري خلال الأشهر والسنوات القليلة القادمة، بينما نمضي في هذه المغامرة معًا. لكن شكرًا لكم لأنه من الواضح أنه يمكننا القيام بكل هذا العمل، ولكن إذا لم نكن نخدم احتياجات قادة المدارس والمعلمين والطلاب، فلماذا نفعل هذا؟ لذلك فإن\nالقدرة على الشراكة معكم تعني الكثير. شكرا لكم جميعا. - شكرا لك، سال.",
    "t_italian": "- Ciao a tutti, sono Sal\ndella Khan Academy e, come alcuni di voi sanno,\nho pubblicato il mio secondo libro, \"Brave New Words\", sul futuro dell'intelligenza artificiale\nnell'istruzione e nel lavoro. È disponibile ovunque\ntu possa acquistare i tuoi libri. Ma come parte della ricerca per quel libro, ho fatto alcune interviste con\nalcune persone affascinanti, che stai per guardare. Ho due ospiti davvero interessanti oggi. Ho la dottoressa Peggy Buffington,\nche è il sovrintendente del distretto scolastico di Hobart in Indiana, nella Greater Chicago\nArea, immagino si possa dire. E abbiamo anche il dottor Tim Krieg, che è il direttore del\ncurriculum e dell'istruzione secondaria presso la School City di Hobart. Benvenuti a entrambi. - Grazie per averci ospitato oggi. - Sì, grazie mille.\n- Quindi lasciami iniziare. No, beh, grazie per esserti unito e lasciami iniziare con\nuna domanda molto semplice, prima di entrare in alcune delle cose con cui abbiamo collaborato negli ultimi mesi. Quando ChatGPT è entrato in scena alla\nfine di novembre del 2022, o all'inizio di dicembre, e avete\niniziato a scoprirlo e magari a sentire le voci secondo cui gli studenti avrebbero potuto\nusarlo per saggi o per altre cose, quali\nsono state le vostre reazioni?  ? A cosa stavate pensando? Cosa hai sentito dai tuoi insegnanti? E magari comincio da lei, dottor Buffington. - Beh, all'inizio, e solo\nper darti un po' di background in termini di utilizzo della tecnologia, sai, ho iniziato a leggere tutto\nquello che potevo sull'argomento e a creare un resoconto, comprendendone le complessità. E mi sono avvicinato ad esso\nnel senso che lo farei, con qualsiasi tipo di tecnologia,\nil che sarebbe, wow, come lo\nintegreremo, lo useremo e non ne avremo paura. E penso che questo sia stato\nl'approccio più importante che ho potuto adottare, semplicemente perché\nnon è qualcosa che, diciamo solo, quando è uscito Google o quando abbiamo iniziato a introdurre come usare Internet, la gente\nnon l'ha fatto.  Non ho davvero la minima idea di come lo\nintegrerebbero con l'insegnamento o con il loro curriculum. Quindi ho subito iniziato a pensare a come aiutare le\npersone a vederlo come uno strumento da cui non possono scappare. E fondamentalmente quello che\npensavo davvero sarebbe successo è esattamente quello che è successo. Tutti si sono rivolti al plagio e faremo qualcosa per bloccarlo? E così ho pensato: \"Whoa,\naspetta solo un secondo qui\". Cerchiamo di capirlo, prima di tutto sapevamo che dovevi avere\n18 anni per usare ChatGPT, ma sappiamo che questo non impedisce ai ragazzi di creare account falsi. E sapevamo che avremmo\navuto questo problema, e dobbiamo, dobbiamo\nabbracciarlo e iniziare a capire come usarlo. E francamente, la cosa\nveramente interessante, Sal, è che avevo un bambino di seconda elementare che ha creato il suo mostro riciclato per un progetto, e suo padre lo ha aiutato ad andare su ChatGPT per scrivere una storia al riguardo. Quindi, se gli alunni della seconda elementare\nlo utilizzeranno già, dobbiamo vedere che questo\nsarà uno strumento che i bambini abbracceranno. Allora come possiamo insegnare loro\ncome usarlo in modo etico, ed è la loro voce, e non scappare da essa? E questa è stata la nostra posizione\nfin dall'inizio. Ma posso dirti che\ngli insegnanti dicevano tutti: \"Cosa farai per bloccarlo?\" Fino a quando non abbiamo iniziato ad avere\nquesto tipo di dialogo. Perché dovremmo bloccare qualcosa che potrebbe potenzialmente aiutare uno studente? Dobbiamo solo imparare ad\nusarlo, giusto? - E come rispondi? Perché un buon numero di\nqueste preoccupazioni sono reali. Sono un insegnante di materie umanistiche e sono abituato ad assegnare tesine, e ora gli studenti potrebbero\nusare ChatGPT e, sai, penso che tu non riesca a rilevarlo. So che ci sono persone che affermano che creeranno qualche tecnologia, ma davvero non puoi rilevarlo se qualcuno è anche solo vagamente\ncreativo al riguardo. Cosa avete detto a loro o avete iniziato a cambiare la\npratica all'interno del distretto, e dottor Buffington, puoi continuare e poi sono davvero curioso, Tim, cosa ne pensi di questi problemi. - Beh, voglio dire,\ndirò che c'erano alcuni insegnanti di inglese, puoi immaginare, quelli sono i primi a parlare e dire: \"Wow, sono fuori a fare la polizia\". E guarda, penso che questo sia\nquesto e ho eseguito questo controllo. Ed è stato molto interessante\nvedere il loro approccio alla cosa. E una delle cose in cui\ncredo davvero è che dobbiamo cambiare il modo in cui\nassegniamo le cose ai bambini. E dovrai\nmostrarglielo e insegnargli come usarlo in modo appropriato. Perché ci deve essere discernimento, ci deve essere un uso etico di, è questa la tua voce o la\nvoce di qualcun altro? E come provi che è\nvero, come lo citi e tutte queste cose. Perché ci fa semplicemente\nvedere le cose in modo diverso. Ora, non so quanto velocemente vuoi entrare nelle nostre\nesperienze con Khanmigo, ma quello che posso dire è che\nabbiamo iniziato a guardare, anche prima di pilotare Khanmigo, quale sarebbe un uso accettabile dell'IA? E prima che iniziassero la fase pilota, si trattava davvero di\nassicurarsi che ci fosse discernimento, assicurandoci che\nrappresentassimo la tua voce e non stessi semplicemente copiando\ne incollando qualcosa. Quindi abbiamo iniziato a considerare\nforse una rubrica senza intelligenza artificiale, un po' di intelligenza artificiale, e per cosa\nconsentiresti che venisse utilizzata? E poi, sai, che aspetto ha\nl'intelligenza artificiale in piena regola? E lo userai\nper discorsi e dibattiti? Quindi abbiamo iniziato ad avere\nquel tipo di conversazione non solo per vietarlo completamente, ma per parlare di cosa consentiresti. E poi penso che approfondiremo ciò che abbiamo scoperto con Khanmigo, ma questo è il tipo di dialogo che abbiamo iniziato ad avere con le persone. - Molto utile. E dottor Krieg, qual è il tuo\npunto di vista su entrambi? Qual è stata la tua prima reazione\nquando hai visto ChatGPT entrare in scena e cosa\nhai sentito dai tuoi insegnanti e da altri\nsu come navigare al suo interno? - È un'ottima domanda, ed è davvero molto\ninteressante per me perché il dottor Buffington mi ha fatto\ncondurre un inizio in ritardo, il che, inizio in ritardo significa per noi, tutto il nostro staff è seduto insieme e gli studenti arrivano in ritardo, quindi possiamo fare un lavoro collettivo\nsviluppo professionale. E non ricordo esattamente su cosa lavorasse lo staff\n, ma alla fine, uno dei nostri insegnanti di ingegneria\nè venuto da me e mi ha detto, ed era nel novembre\ndel 2022, e ha detto: \"Ehi  , ho risposto alla domanda.\" Lui dice: \"Cosa ne pensi?\" E così l'ho letto e ho detto: \"Oh, molto ben fatto,\nDaniel, è fantastico\". E lui: \"Non l'ho scritto io\". E io ho detto: \"Va bene\". E così quella è stata la mia prima\nvera iterazione con ChatGPT che l'ha messo sul radar. Ora, essendo uno che è\nstato un insegnante di inglese, sarei negligente se non dicessi a quel punto cosa ho fatto, giusto? Il dottor Buffington ne ha parlato, mi piacciono i libri, puoi vedere i libri dietro di me. Alla dottoressa Buffington piacciono i libri,\nli ha dappertutto. Ho iniziato a fare delle ricerche, vero? E, sai, francamente, penso che ci sia qualcosa di paralizzante in ciò che mi piace chiamare\nacronimi-ite, nel senso che abbiamo acronimi per tutto. E quindi, sai, dissipando\nquesta nozione di simile, cos'è, sai, ChatGPT\no qualunque sia il caso. E arrivi a scoprire che, sai, tutto questo viene incorporato in\nquella che è considerata intelligenza artificiale, giusto? Intelligenza artificiale. E così questo\nmi ha portato lungo una pista del coniglio, se vuoi, per, sai,\nguardare cos'è l'intelligenza artificiale ed è nuova o è in\nun'iterazione diversa, giusto? Quindi sono passato dal non avere\nidea di cosa fosse a leggere, sai,\narticoli sui principali distretti scolastici del\npaese, per esempio, che avrebbero vietato questo, e così via. A quel punto mi sono detto, beh, sai, è comprensibile. È nella natura umana, sai, i sopravvissuti, cercare di proteggere noi stessi, giusto, e alzare quelle siepi di protezione. Bene, più\napprofondisci la cosa, sai, come ex insegnante di inglese, so che molti di\nquesti termini che usiamo, come AI per esempio, sono spesso basati\nsu cose che sono, tu  sai, legato alla fantascienza. Voglio dire, guardi\nindietro all'intelligenza artificiale e, sai, è come \"Il mago di Oz\".  Lo sai, Uomo di Latta, vero? Tipo, è possibile, sai, che io possa avere un essere, se vuoi, questa cosa creata in grado di ragionare, giusto? E quindi è così affascinante,\ncome un uomo di latta senza cuore, giusto, e il concetto di\nrobot artificialmente intelligenti. E guardi indietro e\nquesto non è niente di nuovo, ha assunto un'iterazione diversa man mano che la tecnologia ha raggiunto. E così, sai, ho iniziato\na esaminarlo e ho pensato \"Oh mio Dio\". Sai, negli anni '50, se ne parlava, giusto? E così i filosofi stavano\ncercando di esplorare questo e c'era un, non\nricordo il nome del ragazzo, ma un matematico britannico che cercò di creare la\npossibilità di, sai, c'è la prova di ciò.\n-Alan Turing. - Sì. Ed era come se lo vedessi in\ntutta la fiction, sai. Un piccolo racconto intitolato\n\"Il gioco più pericoloso\". E, sai, considerare\ngli animali e gli esseri umani e la capacità di ragionare\ncome elemento di differenziazione. E quindi, sai, il problema\nera, come tutti sappiamo, che la tecnologia non era pronta,\nsai, in quel momento. E quindi vedi questo come l'intera nozione di intelligenza artificiale che ha appena attraversato\ndecenni di cambiamenti, giusto? Era come sulle montagne russe. Era su e giù e dappertutto. E quindi, sai, questo\novviamente ha portato all'era attuale in cui ci troviamo, dove la tecnologia può tenere il passo, giusto? E così ora vediamo questo\nvero e proprio cambiamento sociale in cui all'improvviso\nl'insegnante di ingegneria usa questa cosa, ma non\nso nemmeno cosa sia, sai, acronimo, ChatGPT. E cosa fai? Hai alzato le tue siepi\ndi protezione, vero? Tipo, non so cosa sia\ned è spaventoso, giusto? E quindi penso che una delle\ncose più importanti fino a quel momento sia stata, sai, non appena abbiamo avuto quella\nconversazione, sai, poi come la dottoressa Buffington,\nin quanto leader quale è, lo sapeva già. Sono arrivato tardi alla festa, vero? Ma poi iniziamo a\nrisolvere i problemi insieme, a pensare ed esplorare. E penso che ciò che rende\nunico questo distretto e perché apprezziamo la\npartnership che abbiamo con Khan e perché penso che siamo in\nlinea con te in questo momento è solo perché, sai, il\nproblema di \"Brave New Words\". Sai, la dottoressa Buffington è una pioniera e non ha paura di guardare le cose in modo non binario, giusto? Avere o non avere, buono o cattivo. E le zone grigie, vero? E questi sono strumenti proprio come le calcolatrici. Guardi le modifiche al\nnuovo SAT digitale, lo sai. Hanno una\ncalcolatrice infusa da Desmos, non esiste più una cosa del genere per il nuovo SAT di una\nsezione con calcolatrice o senza calcolatrice. Bene, questa è la realtà di dove siamo, e non deve necessariamente\nessere distopica se possiamo, secondo il punto del dottor Buffington, lavorare\ncon il nostro staff e gli studenti per essere saggi amministratori di queste risorse, perché non sarà così.  cambiare, vero? E quindi penso per me, sai, la dottoressa Buffington nella sua\ntesi, sai, con cosa inizi,\nuna definizione di termini? E così quando inizi a fare ricerche sulle cose, inizi a realizzare, stiamo parlando della\nstessa cosa, giusto? Stiamo definendo i nostri termini o stiamo semplicemente girando\nintorno a cose che non\ncapiamo nemmeno cosa siano? Giusto? - Giusto, posso\nintervenire solo per un secondo, perché una delle cose, come utente di tecnologia ai\ntempi, negli anni '80, sai, e ho fatto il mio\ntirocinio con Apple Computer in progettazione didattica, e  , sai, e stai cercando di capire come convincere gli insegnanti\nad abbracciare la tecnologia, senza averne paura. E devi davvero dire a te stesso, la cosa numero uno che\nvogliono sapere è, come migliorerà il mio lavoro? In che modo aiuterà i miei studenti? E se non puoi venderli, potresti anche dimenticartelo. E quindi, se riesci a convincerli che ciò migliorerà il loro lavoro e renderà i risultati più\naccessibili ai loro studenti, e loro sono d'accordo con questo, allora devi elaborare un buon piano per insegnare loro come usarlo  . E quindi quello che sento davvero, una delle prime cose\ncosì eccitanti è quando inizi a parlarne con loro, è semplicemente creare un account, giusto? Vuoi sapere come\npreparare la migliore carbonara? Fai quella domanda, giusto,\ne vedi cosa ottieni. E ne sono affascinati. È un po' come usare il motore di ricerca per la prima volta, e ti\nvengono fuori tutti questi risultati e poi dici: \"Beh,\ndevi perfezionarlo per ottenere quello che vuoi.\" Quindi puoi rigenerare le domande, giusto? E così trovano queste piccole\ncose affascinanti, e poi fai quei piccoli passi extra per mostrare loro cose come\ngenerare un biglietto di uscita. E poi iniziano\na vedere un po' di utilità e dicono: \"Whoa!\" Quindi, un esempio calzante, l'insegnante di ingegneria che\nstava parlando con il dottor Krieg, si avvicina e dice: \"Wow, ho appena consegnato la mia borsa di studio alla Hobart Educational Foundation e ho scritto tutto in ChatGPT\". E ovviamente gli è stato assegnato. Ha dovuto modificare alcune cose e ha detto: \"È stato fantastico\". E noi diciamo, va bene, ottimo lavoro, hai trovato un utilizzo per questo. Il mio direttore della tecnologia\ne il mio responsabile IT, il nostro sistema di gestione degli studenti, qualcosa non funzionava bene in un rapporto che dovevano fare. Sono rimasti indietro nel back-end e hanno inserito del codice che pensavano fosse sbagliato, l'hanno inserito in\nChatGPT, quindi è tornato indietro ed è stato corretto. Sono stati in grado di correggerlo\ne hanno detto: \"Wow!\" Il nostro direttore del servizio di ristorazione, esaminando qualcosa che dovevano fare per un rapporto federale, è uscito e stava facendo\nalcune cose in ChatGPT. Ora, come tutti sappiamo,\nnon è finita. Devono ancora controllare le cose e avere discernimento, giusto? Quindi il punto è che,\nquando introduci questo, che si tratti di termini o altro, se non riesci a mostrare qualche grande vantaggio, verrai spento. E poi penso che l'altro aspetto di questo sia insegnare agli insegnanti una volta che\nvedono il lato delle risorse, perché, francamente, il lato delle risorse è\ndavvero ottimo per gli insegnanti quando iniziano a guardarlo, come posso fare compiti che utilizzano questo tipo  della tecnologia? Sai, e penso a\nquella narrazione, a quel saggio e, sai, quando penso\nalle abilità del 21 ° secolo nel collaborare con un team e avere quel discorso\ne dibattito su, sai, cosa\nti sta dicendo l'intelligenza artificiale? E poi ti rigeneri\ne ottieni un'altra risposta e un'altra risposta,\ne sei in quella squadra e stai discutendo e\ndibattendo su cosa è accurato, cosa è reale, cosa è possibile, e poi inizi a formulare una sorta di ipotesi o\ntematica  tipo di situazione in cui lo espanderai. Penso che abbia un grande potenziale, quando insegniamo alle persone\ncome usarlo in modo appropriato. E dobbiamo guardare al futuro e dire che lo faranno. I nostri concorrenti a livello globale\nlo utilizzeranno. Perché mai dovremmo vietare qualcosa? E poi\nusciranno nel mondo reale e lo useranno. Quindi è nostro compito usarlo e usarlo bene. Insegna loro un uso etico, insegna loro come usarlo strategicamente per ottenere un prodotto finale. Quindi penso che i nostri insegnanti abbiano\nbisogno di questo tipo di aiuto. E quindi inizi con: in che modo mi avvantaggia come insegnante? E ora, come lo\nuserò con i miei figli? E ragazzi,\nho delle idee davvero fantastiche su come possiamo usarlo\ncon i bambini, semplicemente con, adoro l'aspetto del coaching, adoro la differenziazione, ma questo è più dal lato Khanmigo, e io  so che ci\narriverai con noi, perché adoro Khanmigo.  Sto solo dicendo. - No, voglio dire, ovviamente\nsono di parte, adoro Khanmigo, ma ne divento sempre più entusiasta ogni volta che ti parlo, dottor Buffington. E, per chi ascolta, molti dei contenuti dell'insegnante sono idee dirette del Dr. Buffington. Quindi il tuo feedback si sta\nsicuramente manifestando nel nostro prodotto. Ma passiamo a questo, perché Hobart era già un distretto piuttosto impegnato,\nfortemente impegnato utilizzando, chiamiamolo pre-AI Khan Academy. Poi vi abbiamo mostrato le\nprime demo di Khanmigo, e da marzo siete\nstati tutti uno dei primi distretti del paese, probabilmente\ndel mondo, a usare Khanmigo in modo sistematico, e\nsembra in modo produttivo. Quali sono state le vostre\nreazioni originali a Khanmigo? Quali domande o aspirazioni\nhai ancora a riguardo? E com'è stata l'esperienza negli ultimi mesi? Inizierò con lei, dottor Buffington, e poi andrò dal dottor Krieg. - Beh, adoro l'aspetto della\nfiducia in uno studente, giusto? Quindi voglio dire, tutto ciò che vuoi leggere sui risultati degli studenti deve iniziare con la costruzione della fiducia che hanno dentro di sé, che sanno di potercela fare. E quindi il nostro compito è assicurarci di dotarli delle competenze necessarie per manifestarsi e avere questo livello di fiducia. E una delle cose che pre-COVID, e poi puoi fare proprio adesso,\n è che hai appena iniziato a notare che i bambini in realtà non fanno domande. Non vogliono alzare la mano. E poi sei l'\ninsegnante che cerca di attirare, stai sollecitando, stai\ninventando agganci, stai cercando di coinvolgere i bambini. È difficile. Eppure posso andare a una scuola elementare e cosa guardo\nfare i bambini su un Chromebook, un iPad, qualunque cosa? Escono automaticamente\n, colpiscono il microfono: \"Mostrami un serpente blu e\ndimmi perché è blu\". Giusto? E adorano quel genere di cose. E quindi sono così propensi\na parlare con il loro dispositivo e adorano la risposta che ricevono, e poi questo li rende un\npo' più entusiasti di chiederlo e di essere un po' più specifici con esso. Quindi una delle cose che adoro guardare questo film con Khanmigo\nè proprio quel tutor, quella guida a lato e i bambini che non hanno paura di\nporre domande al dispositivo. E penso che sia ingegnoso perché si siedono e fanno\ndomande tutto il giorno. E se hanno un\ncompito mirato, diciamo solo che è il saggio di scrittura. E sai, Sal, quando ti ho parlato per la prima volta, stai per scoppiare a ridere, ma stavi parlando di tuo figlio che doveva scrivere un tema, giusto? E quindi avevo solo cinque insegnanti\nche lo stavano sperimentando, ma ne sono così entusiasta che ne sto parlando con tutti, giusto? Dico: \"Non crederesti a\nquello che ci ha mostrato Sal Khan\". E poi ho avuto una studentessa\na cui stavo facendo da mentore alla scuola media, e lei mi ha detto: \"Dottor Buffington, quella\nroba sull'IA è già pronta?\" Perché aveva bisogno di un insegnante di scrittura, giusto? E quindi ho pensato, beh, farò finta di essere un'intelligenza artificiale come Khanmigo, e ho detto: \"Sarò il tuo insegnante di scrittura\". E stavo cercando di far finta di chiedere, di porre una domanda come penso che l'intelligenza artificiale andrebbe bene, e non che io abbia sostituito\nil tuo Khanmigo, Sal. Ma ecco cosa posso dirti.  Ha scritto un saggio di sei paragrafi\nsul mistero ed è stato bellissimo. Aveva bisogno di quell'aiuto extra semplicemente facendo domande\ne ottenendo risposte, e spingendola un po'. Ed è stato bellissimo. E una delle cose che ci hanno detto i nostri insegnanti, quanto è bello avere un tutor,\nun assistente o un allenatore quando non sono disponibile? E l'hanno adorato\nperché vedono i loro, e questi sono insegnanti delle scuole superiori\nche hanno detto, non mi alzo alle due del mattino quando hanno finito di giocare a Minecraft e decidono di iniziare a\nscrivere il loro compito e boom, hanno un insegnamento  assistente, fanno domande,\nvengono a scuola e si sentono sicuri del loro lavoro. E quindi penso che questa\nsia la bellezza di tutto questo. Ora, tornerò comunque\ncome tuo educatore e mi assicurerò che tu abbia\nfatto domanda e che sia la tua voce e che rappresenti\nciò che ti ho assegnato. Ma wow, il\nlivello di fiducia nei bambini è sorprendente. Ed è questo che mi piace.  In qualsiasi momento puoi avere un\ntutor proprio lì e in quel momento, e penso che questa\nsia la parte migliore. Penso che il feedback che siamo stati in grado di darti, che hai reso il programma ancora migliore, sia l'intera cronologia della chat, giusto? Così posso vedere da quanto tempo siete impegnati, che tipo di domande state ponendo, e non si tratta solo di una cosa veloce da copiare e incollare. Sei davvero là fuori\nusando discernimento, perfezionando e ponendo le domande giuste per realizzare un ottimo lavoro. Mi piace questo di questo. Domande, tutoraggio,\nrafforzamento della fiducia. Questo è tutto ciò che vogliamo per i nostri studenti. - Sai, sento due\ntemi davvero potenti lì. Uno è l’\naspetto di costruzione della fiducia, che nell’introspezione ha\ntutto il senso del mondo. Se gli studenti riuscissero ad\nacquisire più sicurezza e ad ottenere risposte alle loro domande,\nsi impegnerebbero di più. E poi l'altro, a\ncui hai appena accennato, che è il processo che si basa solo sull'output. E questo, l'intelligenza artificiale, credo interessante, ci fornisce una lente sul processo\nche non abbiamo mai avuto prima, perché non\nvedrai cosa fa uno studente alle due del mattino mentre\nscrive il suo saggio, e loro  potrebbero convincere\nla sorella maggiore a scriverlo per loro\no qualcosa del genere. E ora prendi un obiettivo. Dottor Krieg, e lei? Sai, qual è stata la tua\nreazione iniziale a Khanmigo, soprattutto rispetto alla\ntua reazione a ChatGPT, e com'è stata l'esperienza finora? - Questa è una bella domanda. Sai, francamente,\nquando sai che puoi frequentare tutti i\ndiversi tipi di seminari e leggere libri e,\nsai, è utile. Ti dà una scintilla. Ma sai, è\ncome prendere quella scintilla e permettere davvero a quella scintilla di assumere una natura organica, fino al punto in cui diventa semplicemente incorporata nel modo in cui fai le cose, giusto? Parliamo di cultura,\nparliamo di clima. E vedo cose come,\nsai, equità e accesso e, sai, parliamo di\nperdita di apprendimento e parliamo di, sai, come l'effetto Matthew, giusto? Quelli che hanno continuano ad avere\ne quelli che non hanno no. Come possiamo colmare questo divario e offrire davvero opportunità?  Ieri ero a un seminario\ncon un collega e stavamo guardando\nil nuovo SAT digitale, e la mia collega, che è\nun'educatrice e un genitore coinvolto, ha detto: \"Beh, sai,\nstavo lavorando con mia figlia e tu  sai, non ha capito questo, quello e quell'altro.\" E quindi, sai, ho pensato,\nbeh, possiamo trovarti un tutor, sai, e dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. E mi ha fatto davvero\nriflettere di nuovo su questa cosa, perché è come, che ne dici di Khanmigo? Beh, secondo te\ne secondo il dottor Buffington, siamo sulla\npista della Khan Academy ormai da molto tempo. L'ho usato dal punto di vista dello studente, dal punto di vista dell'insegnante e\nora, attraverso i distretti di Khan, dal punto di vista amministrativo. Ma quello che vedo con Khanmigo è la capacità di prendere\nle idee che le persone hanno e di farle diventare sistemiche. E così penso che man mano che ci allontaniamo sempre di\npiù dalla memoria meccanica, i\nconfini iniziano a essere sfumati. Voglio dire, i nostri studenti sono\ncreatori, sono produttori, sono cantautori, sono cantanti, sono podcaster, giusto? Sono curatori, sono consumatori di media e informazioni,\nma le creano anche. E allora cosa serve tutto questo?  Ci vuole una maggiore profondità\ndi conoscenza, complessità e interazione con i materiali, giusto? Interagire con i concetti, eccetera. Bene, il problema è, se si\npensa all'effetto Matthew e, sai, alla\ncapacità di alcune situazioni socioeconomiche e culturali, per cui sono in grado di colmare le lacune, identificarle e finanziarle,\nche dire di tutti gli altri? Che dire di coloro che non hanno accesso a questo tipo di cose? E anche se lo facessero,\ncosa succede se non funziona? E così sentiamo tutto, sai, di apatia degli studenti e mancanza di\nimpegno e, sai, qualunque sia il caso, e\nquesta è una domanda che farò. Dirò, okay, diciamo solo che attiriamo l'\nattenzione dei tuoi studenti. Hai un pubblico affascinato. Cosa ne farai? Capovolgiamo la sceneggiatura, giusto? E quindi penso che ciò che è entusiasmante per me, mentre usiamo questa modalità beta di Khanmigo, e mentre la osserviamo,\nvedi gli studenti interagire con conoscenze e concetti in un modo che aumenta la complessità di ciò che stanno facendo  . E non è un'interazione, non è un, il modo migliore per dirlo\nsarebbe una transazione, giusto? Non è solo un, okay, mi\nserve questo, dammi quello. È una relazione continua in cui gli studenti\ninteragiscono con nuovo materiale, o sfidano se stessi, o espandono ciò che\npensavano fosse vero. E la riammissione all'apprendimento è ciò che ci appassiona tutti, giusto? Quindi qui parliamo molto di come troviamo modi per\nunire passioni, scopi, possibilità, eccetera. E quindi quando guardo Khanmigo,\nsecondo il punto del dottor Buffington, se sono un insegnante, non\nti sta insegnando, giusto? Ma cosa può fare? Può aiutare ad aggiornare la conoscenza. Può, sai, creare\ne collaborare con l'insegnante per creare ganci, giusto? Può aiutare l'insegnante\ncreando biglietti di uscita con loro. Può aiutare con la pianificazione delle lezioni. Può darti, sai, c'è\nanche una piccola funzionalità in cui potresti prendere un'intera lezione e trasformarla in una\npiccola poesia divertente, giusto? Puoi co-creare rubriche,\ntutto quel genere di cose, giusto? Obiettivi di apprendimento, usalo come strumento per il punto del Dr. Buffington. E poi, dal lato dello studente. Andare avanti. - Quello, voglio dire, alcune\ndelle cose più eccitanti che stavano scoprendo durante il pilot,\n era che potevi parlare con una figura letteraria. Oh mio Dio! Oppure potresti parlare con qualcuno\nstoricamente e poi lo sei, lo hai semplicemente messo nel momento e ha dato vita all'apprendimento. E quindi è così coinvolgente. Sai, quando ci\npenso, per anni abbiamo detto, la differenziazione, sai, quello era uno dei\npezzi grossi della Khan Academy. E come hai detto tu, e\ncome ha detto il dottor Kreig, stavamo usando Khan Academy,\nsiamo stati i primi ad adottarlo.  Lo amavo.  Ne avevamo uno nostro, abbiamo persino creato il nostro\ndizionario della Khan Academy, era piuttosto divertente come usarlo. Ma cosa mi è piaciuto di questo? Mi è piaciuto che ci fosse differenziazione. C'era quella guida a\nlato, un po' di aiuto extra, giusto? E vedo Khanmigo esattamente così, ma lo vedo anche totalmente coinvolgente. Quindi posso guardarlo, wow,\ndifferenziazione e, come educatore,\nnon ho dovuto fare molto per fornire quella differenziazione. Ed è una guida a lato. Ma allo stesso tempo, non è qualcosa che\ni bambini non vogliono fare.  A loro piace. Ora, uno dei nostri insegnanti di inglese, e questo mi ha fatto impazzire, è che uno dei ragazzi ha detto, e stava interagendo\ncon una figura storica con Khanmigo, e il ragazzo ha detto: \"Questo è più divertente di TikTok\". Allora Sal, ce l'hai fatta. È più illuminante di TikTok. E quando i bambini te lo dicono, sai che c'è qualcosa lì. Ma comunque, penso che\nquesto sia un grande vantaggio. Non è qui che devo solo\nportare a termine il mio compito.  In realtà sono là fuori\ne si stanno impegnando, e lo stanno portando a nuovi livelli. E abbiamo scoperto che alcuni dei ragazzi che facevano parte del\npilot stavano facendo cose che non facevano parte del loro compito. Erano fuori a creare cose,\ncreare aziende simili e inserire questi scenari. Era semplicemente isterico. Non abbiamo chiesto loro di farlo.  A loro è piaciuto davvero tanto. E quindi penso che questo\nsia ciò che vogliamo per i bambini. Vogliamo che si chiedano. Vogliamo che innovino. Vogliamo che\nrisolvano problemi e vadano là fuori, prendano le informazioni\ne facciano qualcosa con esse. Ed è quello che è realmente successo con questo. Penso, ancora una volta, che sia\nbello tornare indietro e guardare, come\neducatore, la cronologia della chat, così so cosa stanno\nfacendo, posso vedere la sicurezza, posso vedere il loro lavoro, eccetera, questo è davvero importante  agli educatori. Ma penso che questo abbia\naperto un significato completamente diverso al coinvolgimento e cosa si stanno chiedendo, e cosa vogliono saperne di più e cosa vogliono farne? E trovo che i\nragazzi che serviamo oggi, penso che abbiano\nun cuore per le altre persone e risolvano i problemi. Penso che\nabbiano un essere imprenditoriale, sai, che\nvogliono fare cose e vogliono avere successo, vogliono che servano altre\npersone, risolvano problemi e vogliono avere successo\ncon ciò che fanno.  ho fatto. Questo è proprio un\npunto di svolta per quanto riguarda l’equità. E penso che il dottor Krieg lo abbia\ndetto piuttosto bene. Posso prendere uno studente di lingua inglese, che abbiamo sperimentato con il nostro insegnante EL, e per loro è semplicemente una svolta. Voglio dire, la loro lingua principale non è un ostacolo per loro. Sono alla pari con i loro compagni di classe. E questo è davvero fantastico. Una delle cose anche che, sai, stiamo parlando con il nostro insegnante di chimica AP, anche lui un insegnante di scuola materna con doppio credito, solo guardando alcune delle equazioni che stavano facendo in chimica. E, sai, Khanmigo\nnon voleva dare loro la risposta, ma li stava sondando\nsu come ottenerla. E quindi ai nostri insegnanti è piaciuto molto, sai. Se sei a casa e stai cercando\ndi risolvere il problema e loro non possono aiutarti, Khanmigo\nera lì per assisterli. Ora, vi dirò\nche tutti hanno detto che a volte i ragazzi cominciavano a fare il prepotente con l'intelligenza artificiale perché volevano solo la\nrisposta e questa non bastava. Quindi questo ha reso gli insegnanti piuttosto felici. Giusto per farti sapere, c'è\nqualche feedback per te.  A volte c'era un po' di bullismo\ncon Khanmigo, e questo, sai,\ncontinuava a spingerli a dire: \" Non ti darò la risposta\". - Sì, dobbiamo insegnare...\n- Ci è piaciuta quella parte. - Penso che la regola d'oro\ndovrebbe applicarsi all'intelligenza artificiale. Tratta l'IA come vorresti essere\ntrattato tu stesso. Voglio dire, sto solo continuando\ncon quella lente di feedback. E non stavo scherzando quando,\nsai, durante il nostro ultimo incontro, abbiamo avuto diversi articoli su Khanmigo che sono usciti direttamente da quell'incontro. Quindi continuerò\na scegliere il vostro cervello. Sapete, alcune delle cose su\ncui stiamo lavorando vanno oltre ciò che\nstate già sperimentando. Stiamo lavorando per dare\nall'intelligenza artificiale, dando a Khanmigo il senso della memoria, in modo che riconosca il tono preferito da un insegnante o da uno studente. Ricorda le conversazioni precedenti e può riprendere da dove eri rimasto. Stiamo aggiungendo elementi\nin cui gli insegnanti possono assegnare tramite Khanmigo sia le\nattività tradizionali della Khan Academy che le attività di intelligenza artificiale. E potenzialmente perfezionare l'\nattività, invece di dire \"Parla con personaggi storici\". Tipo: \"Ehi, voglio che\nparli con Benjamin Franklin e capisci quanto segue\". E quindi\nfaremo cose del genere.  Ne abbiamo già un po', ma ne avremo di più sul reporting, dove Khanmigo funge davvero\nda assistente didattico. Hai menzionato gli studenti di lingua inglese. Abbiamo appena annunciato che ora\nfunziona in tutte le principali lingue. E così uno studente potrebbe fare i suoi compiti di matematica o di chimica in inglese, ma potrebbe ricevere il\nsuo aiuto o il suo tutoraggio in spagnolo, portoghese, hindi o qualunque lingua di cui potrebbe aver bisogno. E poi l'altra cosa\nche speriamo di fare, chiamiamola nei prossimi\nsei mesi, è avere l'intelligenza artificiale, avere attività multiutente, facilitare l'\napprendimento collaborativo tra molti studenti. Quindi potete immaginare che\ninvece di avere un dibattito con l'intelligenza artificiale, forse l'intelligenza artificiale\npotrebbe facilitare un dibattito con diversi studenti. Oppure esegui un dialogo socratico\ncon diversi studenti o fai una simulazione o un\ngioco con diversi studenti. Quindi mi piacerebbe che i vostri\npensieri fossero, sapete, ciò che già esiste di\nquell'elenco di cui vi ho appena parlato, forse siete molto entusiasti. Qualche idea su come modificarlo? Hai qualche dubbio e, dal punto di vista del rischio, cosa ti piacerebbe vedere di più? Ci sono, hai\nriscontrato problemi che vuoi\nassicurarti che possiamo affrontare per rendere le cose più agevoli? Inizierò con lei, dottor Buffington. - Beh, penso che una delle\ncose su cui abbiamo dato feedback, ovviamente a volte rileviamo cose che rappresentano problemi di sicurezza per noi. E penso che tu abbia affrontato, sai, immediatamente hai iniziato a indagare su come possiamo assicurarci che se c'è qualche tipo di rischio per uno studente o per altre persone proprio con quello che noi, esiste un sistema di indicatori. E quindi apprezziamo molto\nche tu abbia accettato quel feedback, perché molte volte siamo in grado di coglierlo in classe o in qualche lavoro o corpo di lavoro, o se uno studente ha parlato con un altro studente o un insegnante  , siamo in grado di rilevare alcuni segnali di situazioni in cui uno studente potrebbe aver bisogno di ulteriore aiuto perché sta\nattraversando un brutto momento. Oppure c'è semplicemente qualche\npotenziale per, sai, un'applicazione sbagliata o\nqualcosa del genere. E quindi penso che tu abbia preso\nabbastanza bene il nostro feedback in termini di preoccupazione per i bambini che potrebbero aver bisogno di un ulteriore\nsupporto socio-emotivo o se la loro sicurezza viene\ncompromessa a casa loro o con altre persone. Penso che questa sia stata una\ndelle nostre maggiori preoccupazioni quando abbiamo avviato il progetto pilota. Perché abbiamo cose del\ngenere in atto in questo momento, e vedo i bambini usare\nKhanmigo più di quanto, voglio dire, penso solo che lo useranno molto. E quindi, se lo useranno molto, mi piace che tu abbia\nincorporato alcune misure di sicurezza. Questo è stato davvero importante per noi. In termini di futuro, penso che sia davvero importante il coinvolgimento e la comunicazione con altre persone. Grazie mille per la parte linguistica che hai appena creato, perché penso che sia di\nvitale importanza in questo momento. E vorrei solo dire, una delle cose che\npenso sia davvero importante, e penso che questo ritorni\nalla vecchia domanda, e lo riceviamo davvero dai\nragazzi delle scuole medie più di chiunque altro, tipo, perché\ndevo imparare  Quello? E penso che avendo degli esperti\nsul campo, se potessimo, oltre al fatto che la parte dell'intelligenza artificiale è quella esperta, quando dici che possono comunicare con altri studenti, mi piacerebbe vedere un database\no, oltre all'esperto di intelligenza artificiale, io  mi piacerebbe vedere\nesperti sul campo. Perché molte volte con la\npreparazione al college e alla carriera e pensando a questi\nsaranno i nostri prossimi leader, sai, parlare con le\npersone e capire cosa fanno per vivere\ne come potrebbe cambiare, e solo l'intero concetto di intelligenza artificiale  . Vorrei fornire un endpoint del caso. Quindi in questo momento, quando pensi\nall'informatica, e parliamo di programmazione e stiamo solo cercando di convincere i\nragazzi a dedicarsi alla programmazione e all'informatica,\nora sarà diverso. L'intelligenza artificiale dà un sapore completamente diverso e penso che abbiano\nbisogno di parlare, oltre all'esperto di intelligenza artificiale, con chi sono quelle persone sul campo? Come la tua gente. Come funziona dietro le quinte? E cosa, e vuoi\nfare questo per vivere? E se ti piace davvero,\nnon è nemmeno un lavoro. Ma penso che ce ne sia bisogno\ndi più. E quindi, sai, c'è del\nsoftware là fuori con cui puoi incontrare un\nesperto qui, un esperto là. Ma dare ai bambini un vero sapore. E poi, voglio dire, puoi ancora, se permetti\nloro di incontrarsi con altri ragazzi, mi piacerebbe vederli\nincontrare altri esperti sul campo. - E' un'idea affascinante. Penso che sappiate tutti che abbiamo\nun'altra organizzazione no-profit consorella che ho fondato durante la\npandemia chiamata schoolhouse.world, che, e l'intera premessa\ndi schoolhouse.world, è, sai, connettere\nil mondo attraverso l'apprendimento e offrire alle persone tutoraggio dal vivo gratuito\ntramite  video conferenza. E il modo in cui lo facciamo è\nsfruttando i volontari. Molti dei volontari sono\nstudenti delle scuole superiori o universitari, ma molti di loro sono professionisti. E quando abbiamo lanciato\nKhanmigo abbiamo iniziato a pensare, beh, forse Khanmigo potrebbe\nessere un ponte interessante tra la tradizionale Khan Academy e forse qualcosa\ncome schoolhouse.world, dove effettivamente\ncompaiono persone reali. E quindi, Peggy, la tua idea,\nsto quasi pensando, e se schoolhouse.world,\npenso che la maggior parte dei professionisti vorrebbe ricambiare in qualche modo.  A loro piacerebbe dirlo,\nsai, la maggior parte dei genitori, quando tornano a casa, vogliono parlare ai loro figli del loro lavoro e i loro figli non sono interessati. Ma i bambini potrebbero essere interessati\nai lavori degli altri genitori, il che tende ad essere il caso. E quindi potrebbe esserci un modo divertente in cui puoi presentarti su\nquesti, diciamo in una scuola, e poi Khanmigo può dire, ehi, ti stavi chiedendo perché è importante. C'è una sessione in corso. Così e così sta mostrando\nchi è un ricercatore di intelligenza artificiale, o chi è un medico, o chi è\nun avvocato, chi può parlare, perché non vai lì, e\nimparerai molto di più sul perché questa algebra è  utile. Quindi adoro quell'idea. Dr. Krieg, altre idee,\ncontinua ad arrivare, non possiamo... - Sì, no, io... -\nE paure e rischi, perché anche quelle sono\nidee che, sai, opportunità per noi di migliorare le cose. - Quindi, francamente, per\nandare dritto al punto, ricordo che da studente non capivo perché\nShakespeare, per esempio. E, sai, al college,\nquando ero uno studente universitario e poi una scuola di specializzazione e quant'altro, ho iniziato ad\napprezzarlo in modo diverso. Ma ironicamente, secondo il punto del dottor Buffington, ciò che veramente ha dato il via a tutto\nè stato questo breve video in cui mi sono imbattuto, dove c'erano attori e attrici che parlavano del perché Shakespeare. E per la prima volta ho\niniziato a vedere il teatro, ad esempio, non solo nella\nsua realtà isolata, come, oh, questo è teatro,\nma come un ponte, se vuoi, come hai detto, verso ogni\nsorta di altre occupazioni.  . E quando riesci a vedere e sentire come le cose sono ibride ora, giusto, le cose non sono più isolate,\npuoi essere in una materia e applicare i concetti, i\nprincipi, le esperienze, non solo ad altre cose\nche stai facendo  attualmente, ma le possibilità sono infinite perché non sappiamo davvero come\naccadrà in seguito, giusto? Non ne siamo nemmeno sempre\nconsapevoli consapevolmente. E quindi, quando penso\nalle attuali attività per gli studenti all'interno, attraverso Khanmigo, vi incoraggio a\ncontinuare a cercare modi per abbattere i silos. E con questo intendo dire che\nè come un modo di scrivere. Per troppo tempo le modalità di scrittura sono state\ninsegnate in un modo singolare. Quindi è come se questa fosse scrittura espositiva, questa fosse scrittura argomentativa,\nquesta fosse scrittura narrativa. Ma, si sa, la ricerca mostra\nche il processo di scrittura dei nostri autori di maggior successo rispecchia quello dei bambini piccoli prima di passare attraverso un\nsistema educativo tradizionale K-12, proprio per quello di cui\nabbiamo parlato prima. Curiosità. È una disciplina? Sicuro. Leggi Stephen King sulla scrittura, ti dirà che è una\ndisciplina, è una scienza, ma deve esserci quella passione. E quindi per me, penso a\nqual è la differenza tra ciò che abbiamo fatto, ciò che stiamo facendo e ciò che potremmo e dovremmo fare. Ciò che dobbiamo iniziare a fare,\npotremmo e dovremmo fare, è abbattere i muri tra le classi, abbattere i muri tra\ndentro e fuori la scuola. Il dottor Buffington potrebbe dirti che le nostre cose di maggior successo in\nquesto momento sono state organiche e\npoi sono diventate sistematiche, dove l'\ninsegnante di ingegneria collabora con l'insegnante di economia, che collabora con l'\ninsegnante di PLTW biomedico. Perché, perché sono allineati alle passioni. Sono allineati alle cose che\nti interessano. Quindi, se guardo a qualcosa\ncome creare una storia, capire quando esci, leggi e ascolti podcast, parte dell'argomentazione\nè la narrazione, giusto? Non esiste qualcosa come, oh,\nquesta è scrittura espositiva, quindi espongo solo informazioni, giusto? Scrivere è disordinato. Il processo di scrittura non è lineare. Tutto evolve e cambia. Quindi, secondo il punto del dottor Buffington\n, due cose qui. Primo, applicare questi argomenti in un modo che li renda sempre più fluidi, ed è per questo che adoro il tuo commento, Sal, sul fatto che il viaggio sia qualcosa che si costruisce su se stesso. E se la capacità dell’intelligenza artificiale è tale da consentire il\nproseguimento della progressione dell’apprendimento, ciò rappresenta un punto di svolta. Avevo una delle mie migliori\ninsegnanti di composizione alla scuola di specializzazione, mi parlava di come, sai, la scrittura alla fine dovrebbe essere\nvalutata, non a questi piccoli, sai tipo, oh, beh, hai\nseguito questo corso e hai guadagnato una A o quel corso e  ha guadagnato una B. Dovrebbe essere, da dove\nhanno iniziato gli studenti e poi dove sono finiti alla fine naturale del segmento. E riguarda quella crescita. Bene, quella crescita è tale che\ninizi a capire, oh, tutto è retorico, giusto? Torni da Platone, a\nSocrate, ad Aristotele, qualunque sia il caso,\ntutto è retorico. Ebbene, i nostri studenti ora si\npresentano a un mondo gigantesco, ma che\npuò anche essere di nicchia, giusto? Come possiamo prendere queste cose che stanno imparando sulla\nstoria, sulla tecnologia, sull'ingegneria, sul\ncorpo umano, tutte queste cose diverse e dire che questo potrebbe applicarsi a campi\nche non esistono nemmeno. Questo potrebbe finire per applicarsi,\npotrebbe essere appiccicoso, giusto? È così che funziona il nostro cervello. Dobbiamo inserire le informazioni nelle cose su cui abbiamo già costruito delle strutture, in modo tale che ora sto combinando qualcosa che sto facendo in classe\ncon il trambusto che ho, sai, un negozio che faccio\nsul lato  o qualsiasi altra cosa, e anche a mio agio nelle mie preferenze\npersonali e, sai, e qualunque sia il caso. Quindi, ad esempio, se ascolto\npodcast su argomenti legati allo sport, ciò\npotrebbe cambiare il modo in cui eseguo una\nsessione registrata per lo staff, perché mi piace il modo\nin cui introducono questo o quello  , sai, usa l'inflessione della voce lì e quant'altro. Quindi il mio incoraggiamento sarebbe duplice. Primo, continuare ad abbattere\nquei silos per mostrare come tutta questa roba si inserisce\nin altre cose, giusto? E poi due, ce n'è un po'\nproprio adesso a Khanmigo, in quanto riguarda la\nnavigazione tra le ammissioni al college e gli aiuti finanziari, sai, e poi anche l'aspetto della carriera. Quindi direi che\nti incoraggio a continuare a connettere gli studenti e\nciò che stanno imparando o potrebbero imparare, e poi cosa. E quando pensi\nallo stato dell'Indiana, ad esempio, molto di ciò che il dottor\nBuffington, io e il nostro team stiamo facendo qui è aiutare ad allineare\nciò che gli studenti stanno facendo ora con credenziali impilabili di valuta, mostrando futuri datori di lavoro,\ncomitati di borse di studio,  eccetera, che ho padronanza di qualcosa\no competenza in qualcosa o esperienza in qualcosa. Lo vediamo anche con i badge digitali e cose del genere. Quindi, quando uno studente vede un percorso professionale, è intimidatorio perché\nil linguaggio utilizzato per caratterizzarlo potrebbe\nnon avere nulla a che fare con ciò che realmente comporta l'occupazione. E/o le future occupazioni\nper cui potrei usare queste cose non esistono nemmeno, giusto? E quindi come possiamo provare\na unire questi mondi per connettere gli studenti\npresenti con il loro futuro a breve termine, così come, sapete, le opportunità\nche esisteranno da allora in poi e di cui ancora non siamo nemmeno a conoscenza. - Adoro questo tipo di tema dell'abbattimento delle barriere tra gli argomenti, che penso sia ora\npiù fattibile che mai. E poi anche tra\nscuola e mondo reale. Un'ultima domanda per lei, dottor Buffington. Andiamo avanti velocemente, non lo\nso, due, tre anni. Non deve passare molto tempo, ma le cose stanno cambiando molto velocemente. Pensi che tutto ciò di cui\nabbiamo parlato cambierà in qualche modo radicalmente il modo in cui\nè la scuola, incluso, sai, non abbiamo nemmeno parlato di\ncose come la valutazione, a cui stiamo iniziando a\npensare da parte nostra. O pensi che sarà semplicemente\nun bel supplemento all'architettura esistente? O pensa che in qualche modo questo cambi radicalmente la classe\n, dottor Buffington? - Beh, voglio dire, Tim lo\nsaprà, dottor Krieg. Voglio dire, la mia filosofia era\nche, sai, durante il COVID, il panorama era\ncambiato per sempre, giusto? Voglio dire, è già cambiato. Se non voglio venire\nnel mio istituto pubblico e stare seduto tutto il giorno, posso scegliere\ndi frequentare una scuola online e, sai, forse per me funziona. Penso che, quando lo guardo, non voglio vederlo come un supplemento. Voglio vederlo come uno strumento\nche è, sai, utilizzabile ora, ma è anche in grado di\naiutarci in futuro. Sai, quando penso alle cose e penso alla\npreparazione per la carriera universitaria, e, sai, in questo momento posso lasciare che un ragazzo\nesca presto, si diplomi presto, e, sai, ho\nfigli che si stanno diplomando con una laurea in  la\nnostra scuola superiore in questo momento. Cosa vedo che potrebbe accadere qui? Vedo cosa vuole la gente dai ragazzi che si stanno diplomando adesso. Vogliono che siano risolutori di problemi. Vogliono che siano in grado di\ncollaborare e lavorare in squadra. Vogliono che abbiano alle\nspalle pratiche etiche. E penso che tu\nabbia già il potenziale con questo. Ora la cosa interessante è questa, come posso dare uno stage a uno studente, e forse a Khanmigo c'è\nun aspetto di stage in questo e conta per la sua giornata. Sai, il mio obiettivo è\nreinventare la scuola superiore e come appare. E, sai, penso che\nquesto arrivi fino alla scuola media, alle elementari. Penso che ci siano così tanti\naspetti diversi di questa IA che potrei esplorare. Sai, quando penso che i\nbambini vogliono divertirsi, non vogliono temere gli incarichi, vedo già che quella parte è risolta. Vedo ragazzi che vanno lì\nsolo perché lo vogliono e gli piace fare domande. Ed è quello che vogliamo come educatori. Vogliamo che facciano domande. E ne sono affascinati. E quindi voglio prendere quel\nfascino e svilupparlo. E se questo significa riprogettare\nil modo in cui facciamo scuola, allora dobbiamo farlo, giusto? E quindi abbiamo già riprogettato e reinventato le nostre\nscuole superiori con l'università anticipata e, sai, puoi ottenere\ncertificazioni di settore un anno di college, due anni di college. Non devi necessariamente\nandare cinque giorni a settimana. Forse non hai bisogno di andarci un'intera giornata. Perché puoi avere\nun'opportunità diversa. E se questa opportunità si\npresenta in questo modo, hai le credenziali per laurearti e forse anche per entrare nel mondo del lavoro o entrare in un corso post-secondario per esplorare ulteriormente ciò che stiamo cercando di\nottenere con, sai, alcune credenziali post-secondarie che contribuiscono  al mondo. E quindi mi chiedo:\nesistono modi migliori, modi più efficienti o\nmodi più entusiasmanti e coinvolgenti per reinventare le cose che stiamo facendo? E penso che, come tutto ciò che è\nnuovo nel campo dell'istruzione, a volte siamo gli ultimi ad adottarlo. E allora perché? E penso che abbiamo iniziato a parlare di questo.  Ne hanno paura. E non puoi averne paura, devi abbracciare cos'è il futuro. E quindi penso che ci\nsarà una certa adattabilità quando parli di\nsupplementi, giusto? Voglio dire, quindi in questo momento\navrete i primi ad adottare che fondamentalmente prenderanno qualcosa che hanno nella loro\nmappa del curriculum e diranno: \"In che modo l'intelligenza artificiale mi aiuta?\" \"Come potrei usare Khanmigo?\" E poi\ninizierai a vedere alcuni pionieristici in cui sarà come, whoa,\nnon lo sono, non è un sostituto. E li vedrete\niniziare a usarlo in un modo che lo migliora ancora di più, e non si sostituirà come hanno fatto loro. E sta spingendo i bambini\na crescere e imparare e forse ad avere l'idea\nche potrebbero curare qualcosa. Sai, mi piace il fatto\nche questa sia una generazione a cui piace risolvere i problemi. E diranno: \"Che ne dici di questo?\" Oppure: \"Che ne dici?\" E penso che questo abbia\nil potenziale per farlo. Quindi, se ho uno studente e, sai, per parlare di quello di cui stavamo parlando, metteremo i ragazzi in un corso di biomedicina e poi li faremo confrontarsi con il programma di ingegneria, perché stanno pensando a una cosa e  queste sono le persone qui che possono davvero costruirlo per te o aiutarti con i tuoi\ncalcoli o altro. Quelle barriere sono rotte. E vedo che la scuola superiore\nviene totalmente reinventata dando ai ragazzi l'\nopportunità di applicarlo in un contesto del mondo reale. E quindi penso che ci sia spazio per questo, e qui ti darò solo\nun concetto di, sai, che l' Indiana sta facendo qualcosa con i\nconti delle borse di studio per la carriera.  Si chiamano CSA. Ed è davvero pensato per inserire i\nragazzi nel mondo del lavoro, nell'apprendimento e nei tirocini basati sul lavoro. E sono già sul punto di chiedersi come sarebbe un diploma di scuola superiore con un ragazzo a cui diamo questo CSA? Ed è davvero tradizionale, come se dovessi avere 40 crediti\ndi questo e quello e quello. E stanno iniziando a capire che, beh, forse non ne hanno bisogno. E forse, solo forse,\nsaranno qualcuno che inserirò nel mondo del lavoro che abbia un po' di know-how\nnell'uso della tecnologia in modo appropriato, e troveranno una soluzione per qualcosa che hanno faticato a trovare. Penso che il potenziale ci sia per questo. Penso che vedrai i\nprimi utenti che integrano, sostituiscono e poi trovano cose nuove. E poi penso che\nvedrai i bambini dire, potrei fare questo, potrei fare quello. E dovremo riesaminare\nil modo in cui stiamo offrendo per consentire la crescita, se ciò ha senso. - Ha molto senso. E, sapete, potrei parlare\ncon entrambi per ore, soprattutto di questo argomento,\nperché è così affascinante. Ma adoro quel tipo di\nspinta finale in cui, sai, si rompono tutti i confini e in realtà riceviamo sempre le nostre idee, idee per le attività da te, dottor Buffington. E in un certo senso hai rafforzato qualcosa su cui stavamo facendo un brainstorming, ovvero cosa accadrebbe se ci fosse\nun'attività per studenti, o insegnanti o chiunque altro, per risolvere i grandi problemi del mondo. Sai, hai bisogno di noi,\ndevi affrontare il clima, vuoi capire\ncome posso, da studente, iniziare ad affrontare il cambiamento climatico? Come posso, da studente,\niniziare ad affrontare la ricerca sul cancro? Come posso, da studente,\niniziare ad affrontare, non lo so, qualunque problema nel mondo\ntu pensi debba essere risolto. Molti studenti vorrebbero farlo, ma non sanno da dove\ncominciare, quindi dove andare, quindi mi piace anche questa idea. Beh, grazie a entrambi ... E Sal può, Sal posso\nsolo menzionarlo in termini di ciò che hai appena detto e di\nquanto sia importante, e loro cercano di risolvere le cose\nche sono così importanti per loro. Quindi durante il COVID, uno dei miei\nstudenti stava cercando di capire come avere un migliore\nsistema di check-in con i sintomi al pronto soccorso. - Hmm.\n- E perché. Voleva che li informasse che devi ridefinire le priorità su\nchi si trova al pronto soccorso, perché suo nonno è morto di COVID. Quindi ho avuto questo piccolo\nimprenditore innovatore, e abbiamo spazi per i maker\nqui, facciamo, sai, facciamo fiere dei maker, abbiamo, e abbiamo spazi STEM ovunque. E la sua creazione è stata, e ha lavorato con gli\ningegneri dell'ospedale sui sintomi e su dove si trovano, e su come dare la priorità a chi\nvedrai per primo, perché era così reale per lei e per te. Sapete, quando si\nparla di cambiamento climatico, di cose che contano davvero per loro, passano tutto il giorno. Questo è il tipo di studente\nche non va a letto perché è là fuori\na cercare di capire dove sono le informazioni,\nche tipo di strumento, che tipo di strumento. Frequenta il corso di biomedicina, scende al corso di ingegneria e stanno creando un palmare, che si sincronizzerà\ncon gli orologi o qualsiasi altra cosa in ospedale, per cambiare\nla priorità del tipo, chi devi vedere adesso? E penso solo che i nostri figli\nabbiano questo potenziale, giusto? E quindi, indovina un po', questo non è\nsuccesso nella sua classe, è successo fuori dalla sua classe, ma lei ha portato in classe che deve esserci un modo migliore. Giusto? E quindi penso che questo\napra tutti i tipi di strade a domande o problemi\nche vogliono risolvere, e dà loro un buon inizio e li farà desiderare di\nandare avanti. Sai cosa voglio dire? E penso che sia questo il bello. È così coinvolgente che non vogliono fermarsi al 100%. Non potrei essere più d'accordo.\n- Sal, se posso. Solo a nome di entrambi,\nsai, grazie per, sai, è quello che hai fatto, giusto? Hai iniziato identificando\nun problema, un bisogno, giusto, che era personale per\nte in senso familiare. E hai fatto un sacco di\ndomande e hai aperto la strada, e poi, sai, eccoci qui, giusto? E quindi la nostra speranza è che, per quanto \nnoi tre siamo appassionati, ad esempio, dell'istruzione e, sai, di Khanmigo, e semplicemente di modi diversi per\ncercare di aiutare i nostri studenti, sai, ad essere in missione, ad essere in grado  per perseguire le proprie passioni. Se possono avere lo stesso tipo di passione per le cose a cui sono interessati, e noi stiamo unendo le possibilità in cui possono perseguirle, allora, sai, l'istruzione potrebbe sembrare diversa,\nma l'aspetto fondamentale, sai, la vera Stella Polare rimane la stessa. Giusto? - 100%.\n- E poi lo facciamo in\nmodi diversi, sai. Ma il perché è ancora lì. Il denominatore è ancora lì. E questi sono i nostri figli, questi sono i nostri studenti. E quindi solo grazie, penso, a nome di entrambi,\nper aver sostenuto questo. - No, beh, grazie a tutti\nper aver preso parte a questa cosa. - Oh, ehi...\n- Per essermi preso un po' di tempo. - Questo.\n- O si. - Questa è stata la cosa migliore di sempre. Voglio dire, non ti sto prendendo in giro. Potevo sedermi e parlare con\ngli insegnanti e i bambini che lo usavano. Potevo sedermi con loro tutto il giorno, e io, e loro mi mandavano\ncose che stavano creando da Khanmigo, e lo adoravo e ho altro lavoro da fare, ma volevo leggere cosa ne\nstavano facendo. E, sai, penso, solo complimenti e grazie per averci\nincluso nel pilot. Penso che saremo\npionieri nell'uscire e parlare alla gente di come, sai, come rompere le barriere\ne come usarlo. Ma non è possibile farlo\nsenza dare alle persone un primo avvio. Giusto? E lo avete fatto, e\nvi sto solo dicendo che è affascinante sedersi e\nparlare con questi insegnanti di come pensano che lo useranno in seguito. E quindi grazie per questo. Hai preso qualcosa di cui penso che avessero tanta paura, soprattutto gli insegnanti di inglese. E non ne hanno paura. E quindi sanno come\naffrontarlo. Sai, hanno parlato con la nostra segretaria\nall'Istruzione, Katie Jenner, il che è interessante perché\nhai parlato con Katie Jenner e lei ha detto: \"Ehi, voglio\nparlare con quegli insegnanti\". E così l'abbiamo messo in fila e\nanche lei ne è rimasta affascinata. Quindi hai preso qualcosa e\nci hai fornito uno strumento davvero valido da utilizzare nell'istruzione. E per questo ne siamo grati e non vedo l'ora di vedere la prossima versione. - No, siamo emozionati e\npenso che questa sarà una delle tante conversazioni nei prossimi mesi e anni, mentre affronteremo questa avventura insieme. Ma grazie perché sapete, ovviamente possiamo fare tutto questo lavoro, ma se non serviamo i bisogni dei dirigenti scolastici, degli insegnanti e degli studenti, allora perché lo stiamo facendo? Quindi significa molto\npoter collaborare con tutti voi. Grazie a tutti. - Grazie, Sal."
